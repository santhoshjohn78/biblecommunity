<h2>Psalms 87</h2>

<p><a id="c87_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> His foundation is in the holy mountains. <a id="c87_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob. <a id="c87_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God.</p>

<p><a id="c87_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know me: Behold, Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: This one was born there. <a id="c87_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Yea, of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her; And the Most High himself will establish her. <a id="c87_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Jehovah will count, when he writeth up the peoples, This one was born there.</p>

<p><a id="c87_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> They that sing as well as they that dance shall say, All my fountains are in thee.</p>
