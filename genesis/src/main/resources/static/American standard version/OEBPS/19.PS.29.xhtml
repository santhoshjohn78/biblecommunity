<h2>Psalms 29</h2>

<p><a id="c29_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Ascribe unto Jehovah, O ye sons of the mighty, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength. <a id="c29_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name; Worship Jehovah in holy array.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters: The God of glory thundereth, Even Jehovah upon many waters. <a id="c29_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The voice of Jehovah is powerful; The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty. <a id="c29_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars; Yea, Jehovah breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. <a id="c29_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox. <a id="c29_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The voice of Jehovah cleaveth the flames of fire. <a id="c29_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The voice of Jehovah shaketh the wilderness; Jehovah shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. <a id="c29_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to calve, And strippeth the forests bare: And in his temple everything saith, Glory.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Jehovah sat as King at the Flood; Yea, Jehovah sitteth as King for ever. <a id="c29_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Jehovah will give strength unto his people; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.</p>
