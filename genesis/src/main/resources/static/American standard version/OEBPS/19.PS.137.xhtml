<h2>Psalms 137</h2>

<p><a id="c137_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat down, yea, we wept, When we remembered Zion. <a id="c137_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Upon the willows in the midst thereof We hanged up our harps. <a id="c137_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For there they that led us captive required of us songs, And they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. <a id="c137_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> How shall we sing Jehovahâ€™s song In a foreign land? <a id="c137_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget her skill. <a id="c137_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, If I remember thee not; If I prefer not Jerusalem Above my chief joy. <a id="c137_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Remember, O Jehovah, against the children of Edom The day of Jerusalem; Who said, Rase it, rase it, Even to the foundation thereof. <a id="c137_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed, Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee As thou hast served us. <a id="c137_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones Against the rock.</p>
