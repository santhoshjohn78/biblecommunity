<h2>Psalms 54</h2>

<p><a id="c54_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Save me, O God, by thy name, And judge me in thy might. <a id="c54_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth. <a id="c54_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For strangers are risen up against me, And violent men have sought after my soul: They have not set God before them.</p>

<p><a id="c54_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Behold, God is my helper: The Lord is of them that uphold my soul. <a id="c54_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He will requite the evil unto mine enemies: Destroy thou them in thy truth. <a id="c54_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> With a freewill-offering will I sacrifice unto thee: I will give thanks unto thy name, O Jehovah, for it is good. <a id="c54_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; And mine eye hath seen my desire upon mine enemies.</p>
