<p><a id="c145_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I will extol thee, my God, O King; And I will bless thy name for ever and ever. <a id="c145_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Every day will I bless thee; And I will praise thy name for ever and ever. <a id="c145_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised; And his greatness is unsearchable. <a id="c145_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> One generation shall laud thy works to another, And shall declare thy mighty acts. <a id="c145_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Of the glorious majesty of thine honor, And of thy wondrous works, will I meditate. <a id="c145_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts; And I will declare thy greatness. <a id="c145_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> They shall utter the memory of thy great goodness, And shall sing of thy righteousness. <a id="c145_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Jehovah is gracious, and merciful; Slow to anger, and of great lovingkindness. <a id="c145_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Jehovah is good to all; And his tender mercies are over all his works. <a id="c145_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah; And thy saints shall bless thee. <a id="c145_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, And talk of thy power; <a id="c145_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, And the glory of the majesty of his kingdom. <a id="c145_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And thy dominion endureth throughout all generations. <a id="c145_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Jehovah upholdeth all that fall, And raiseth up all those that are bowed down. <a id="c145_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The eyes of all wait for thee; And thou givest them their food in due season. <a id="c145_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Thou openest thy hand, And satisfiest the desire of every living thing. <a id="c145_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Jehovah is righteous in all his ways, And gracious in all his works. <a id="c145_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Jehovah is nigh unto all them that call upon him, To all that call upon him in truth. <a id="c145_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; He also will hear their cry and will save them. <a id="c145_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Jehovah preserveth all them that love him; But all the wicked will he destroy. <a id="c145_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> My mouth shall speak the praise of Jehovah; And let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.</p>
