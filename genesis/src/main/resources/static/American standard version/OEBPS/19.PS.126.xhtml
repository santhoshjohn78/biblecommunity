<h2>Psalms 126</h2>

<p><a id="c126_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> When Jehovah brought back those that returned to Zion, We were like unto them that dream. <a id="c126_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Then was our mouth filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing: Then said they among the nations, Jehovah hath done great things for them. <a id="c126_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jehovah hath done great things for us, Whereof we are glad. <a id="c126_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Turn again our captivity, O Jehovah, As the streams in the South. <a id="c126_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. <a id="c126_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with him.</p>
