<h2>Jeremiah 50</h2>

<p><a id="c50_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The word that Jehovah spake concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet. <a id="c50_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Declare ye among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed; her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed. <a id="c50_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and beast. <a id="c50_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek Jehovah their God. <a id="c50_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come ye, and join yourselves to Jehovah in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten. <a id="c50_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting-place. <a id="c50_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Jehovah, the habitation of righteousness, even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers. <a id="c50_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks. <a id="c50_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For, lo, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain. <a id="c50_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Chaldea shall be a prey: all that prey upon her shall be satisfied, saith Jehovah. <a id="c50_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Because ye are glad, because ye rejoice, O ye that plunder my heritage, because ye are wanton as a heifer that treadeth out the grain, and neigh as strong horses; <a id="c50_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> your mother shall be utterly put to shame; she that bare you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the hindermost of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. <a id="c50_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Because of the wrath of Jehovah she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. <a id="c50_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against Jehovah. <a id="c50_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Shout against her round about: she hath submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Jehovah: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her. <a id="c50_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land. <a id="c50_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. <a id="c50_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. <a id="c50_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead. <a id="c50_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> In those days, and in that time, saith Jehovah, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant. <a id="c50_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: slay and utterly destroy after them, saith Jehovah, and do according to all that I have commanded thee. <a id="c50_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction. <a id="c50_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! <a id="c50_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against Jehovah. <a id="c50_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Jehovah hath opened his armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a work <a id="c50_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Come against her from the utmost border; open her store-houses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left. <a id="c50_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. <a id="c50_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of his temple. <a id="c50_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Call together the archers against Babylon, all them that bend the bow; encamp against her round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her; for she hath been proud against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel. <a id="c50_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith Jehovah. <a id="c50_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts; for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee. <a id="c50_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And the proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that are round about him. <a id="c50_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all that took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go. <a id="c50_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Their Redeemer is strong; Jehovah of hosts is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon. <a id="c50_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith Jehovah, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men. <a id="c50_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> A sword is upon the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed. <a id="c50_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed. <a id="c50_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of graven images, and they are mad over idols. <a id="c50_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. <a id="c50_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein. <a id="c50_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> Behold, a people cometh from the north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth. <a id="c50_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon. <a id="c50_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> The king of Babylon hath heard the tidings of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail. <a id="c50_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> Behold, the enemy shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that can stand before me? <a id="c50_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them. <a id="c50_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembleth, and the cry is heard among the nations.</p>
