<h2>Proverbs 21</h2>

<p><a id="c21_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The kingâ€™s heart is in the hand of Jehovah as the watercourses: He turneth it whithersoever he will. <a id="c21_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes; But Jehovah weigheth the hearts. <a id="c21_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> To do righteousness and justice Is more acceptable to Jehovah than sacrifice. <a id="c21_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> A high look, and a proud heart, Even the lamp of the wicked, is sin. <a id="c21_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; But every one that is hasty hasteth only to want. <a id="c21_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The getting of treasures by a lying tongue Is a vapor driven to and fro by them that seek death. <a id="c21_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away, Because they refuse to do justice. <a id="c21_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding crooked; But as for the pure, his work is right. <a id="c21_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, Than with a contentious woman in a wide house. <a id="c21_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The soul of the wicked desireth evil: His neighbor findeth no favor in his eyes. <a id="c21_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> When the scoffer is punished, the simple is made wise; And when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. <a id="c21_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The righteous man considereth the house of the wicked, How the wicked are overthrown to their ruin. <a id="c21_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, He also shall cry, but shall not be heard. <a id="c21_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> A gift in secret pacifieth anger; And a present in the bosom, strong wrath. <a id="c21_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> It is joy to the righteous to do justice; But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. <a id="c21_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding Shall rest in the assembly of the dead. <a id="c21_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. <a id="c21_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; And the treacherous cometh in the stead of the upright. <a id="c21_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> It is better to dwell in a desert land, Than with a contentious and fretful woman. <a id="c21_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; But a foolish man swalloweth it up. <a id="c21_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> He that followeth after righteousness and kindness Findeth life, righteousness, and honor. <a id="c21_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, And bringeth down the strength of the confidence thereof. <a id="c21_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue Keepeth his soul from troubles. <a id="c21_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The proud and haughty man, scoffer is his name; He worketh in the arrogance of pride. <a id="c21_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The desire of the sluggard killeth him; For his hands refuse to labor. <a id="c21_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> There is that coveteth greedily all the day long; But the righteous giveth and withholdeth not. <a id="c21_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination: How much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind! <a id="c21_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> A false witness shall perish; But the man that heareth shall speak so as to endure. <a id="c21_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> A wicked man hardeneth his face; But as for the upright, he establisheth his ways. <a id="c21_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> There is no wisdom nor understanding Nor counsel against Jehovah. <a id="c21_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> The horse is prepared against the day of battle; But victory is of Jehovah.</p>
