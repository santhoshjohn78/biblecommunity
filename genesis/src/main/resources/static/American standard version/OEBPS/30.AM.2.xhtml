<h2>Amos 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Moab, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime: <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> but I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet; <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith Jehovah. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after which their fathers did walk: <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> but I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes- <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> they that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father go unto the same maiden, to profane my holy name: <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith Jehovah. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not. <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Behold, I will press you in your place, as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And flight shall perish from the swift; and the strong shall not strengthen his force; neither shall the mighty deliver himself; <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself; neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself; <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith Jehovah.</p>
