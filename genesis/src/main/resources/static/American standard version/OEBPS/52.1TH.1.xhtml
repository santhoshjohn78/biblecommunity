<h2>1 Thessalonians 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace. <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers; <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father; <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election, <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> how that our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; even as ye know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward you for your sake. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit; <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything. <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve a living and true God, <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivereth us from the wrath to come.</p>
