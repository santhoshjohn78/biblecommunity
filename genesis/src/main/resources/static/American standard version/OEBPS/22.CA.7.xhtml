<h2>Song of Solomon 7</h2>

<p><a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince’s daughter! Thy rounded thighs are like jewels, The work of the hands of a skilful workman. <a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thy body is like a round goblet, Wherein no mingled wine is wanting: Thy waist is like a heap of wheat Set about with lilies. <a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe. <a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thy neck is like the tower of ivory; Thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon Which looketh toward Damascus. <a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the hair of thy head like purple; The king is held captive in the tresses thereof. <a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! <a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, And thy breasts to its clusters. <a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I said, I will climb up into the palm-tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof: Let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, And the smell of thy breath like apples, <a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And thy mouth like the best wine, That goeth down smoothly for my beloved, Gliding through the lips of those that are asleep.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I am my beloved’s; And his desire is toward me. <a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; Let us lodge in the villages. <a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Let us get up early to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine hath budded, And its blossom is open, And the pomegranates are in flower: There will I give thee my love. <a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The mandrakes give forth fragrance; And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</p>
