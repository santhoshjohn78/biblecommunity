<h2>Lamentations 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us: Behold, and see our reproach. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Our inheritance is turned unto strangers, Our houses unto aliens. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> We are orphans and fatherless; Our mothers are as widows. <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> We have drunken our water for money; Our wood is sold unto us. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Our pursuers are upon our necks: We are weary, and have no rest. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> We have given the hand to the Egyptians, And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Our fathers sinned, and are not; And we have borne their iniquities. <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Servants rule over us: There is none to deliver us out of their hand. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> We get our bread at the peril of our lives, Because of the sword of the wilderness. <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Our skin is black like an oven, Because of the burning heat of famine. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> They ravished the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Princes were hanged up by their hand: The faces of elders were not honored. <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The young men bare the mill; And the children stumbled under the wood. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The elders have ceased from the gate, The young men from their music. <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The joy of our heart is ceased; Our dance is turned into mourning. <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The crown is fallen from our head: Woe unto us! for we have sinned. <a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For this our heart is faint; For these things our eyes are dim; <a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate: The foxes walk upon it.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Thou, O Jehovah, abidest for ever; Thy throne is from generation to generation. <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, And forsake us so long time? <a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Turn thou us unto thee, O Jehovah, and we shall be turned; Renew our days as of old. <a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But thou hast utterly rejected us; Thou art very wroth against us.</p>
