<h2>Psalms 61</h2>

<p><a id="c61_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Hear my cry, O God; Attend unto my prayer. <a id="c61_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> From the end of the earth will I call unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: Lead me to the rock that is higher than I. <a id="c61_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For thou hast been a refuge for me, A strong tower from the enemy. <a id="c61_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: I will take refuge in the covert of thy wings.</p>

<p><a id="c61_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: Thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name. <a id="c61_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thou wilt prolong the kingâ€™s life; His years shall be as many generations. <a id="c61_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He shall abide before God for ever: Oh prepare lovingkindness and truth, that they may preserve him. <a id="c61_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, That I may daily perform my vows.</p>
