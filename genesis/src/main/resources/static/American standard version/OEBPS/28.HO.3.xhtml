<h2>Hosea 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah said unto me, Go again, love a woman beloved of her friend, and an adulteress, even as Jehovah loveth the children of Israel, though they turn unto other gods, and love cakes of raisins. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley; <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any manâ€™s wife: so will I also be toward thee. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim: <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek Jehovah their God, and David their king, and shall come with fear unto Jehovah and to his goodness in the latter days.</p>
