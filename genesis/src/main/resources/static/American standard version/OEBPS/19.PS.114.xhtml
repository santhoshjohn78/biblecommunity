<h2>Psalms 114</h2>

<p><a id="c114_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> When Israel went forth out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language; <a id="c114_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. <a id="c114_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The sea saw it, and fled; The Jordan was driven back. <a id="c114_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs. <a id="c114_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back? <a id="c114_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; Ye little hills, like lambs? <a id="c114_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob, <a id="c114_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of waters.</p>
