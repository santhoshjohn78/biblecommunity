<h2>Colossians 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> If then ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth. <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For ye died, and your life is hid with Christ in God. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> When Christ, who is our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry; <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> for which things’ sake cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience: <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> wherein ye also once walked, when ye lived in these things; <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> but now do ye also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth: <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> lie not one to another; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings, <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and have put on the new man, that is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him: <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Put on therefore, as God’s elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering; <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man have a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you, so also do ye: <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to the which also ye were called in one body; and be ye thankful. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And whatsoever ye do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord. <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged. <a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Servants, obey in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord: <a id="c3_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> whatsoever ye do, work heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men; <a id="c3_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the Lord Christ. <a id="c3_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> For he that doeth wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</p>
