<p><a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were forty and four thousand seven hundred and threescore, that were able to go forth to war. <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And they made war with the Hagrites, with Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab. <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And they were helped against them, and the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them; for they cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated of them, because they put their trust in him. <a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men a hundred thousand. <a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For there fell many slain, because the war was of God.
