<h2>Hebrews 7</h2>

<p><a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, <a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace; <a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God), abideth a priest continually. <a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Now consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils. <a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priestâ€™s office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham: <a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of Abraham, and hath blessed him that hath the promises. <a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better. <a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And here men that die receive tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. <a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes; <a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him. <a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it hath the people received the law), what further need <a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law. <a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe, from which no man hath given attendance at the altar. <a id="c7_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests. <a id="c7_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And what we say is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest, <a id="c7_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> who hath been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life: <a id="c7_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> for it is witnessed of him, Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness <a id="c7_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> (for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God. <a id="c7_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And inasmuch as it is not without the taking of an oath <a id="c7_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> (for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him, The Lord sware and will not repent himself, Thou art a priest for ever);</p>

<p><a id="c7_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant. <a id="c7_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing: <a id="c7_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> but he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable. <a id="c7_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. <a id="c7_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; <a id="c7_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself. <a id="c7_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, appointeth a Son, perfected for evermore.</p>
