<h2>1 Corinthians 9</h2>

<p><a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord? <a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. <a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> My defence to them that examine me is this. <a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Have we no right to eat and to drink? <a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? <a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working? <a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? <a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same? <a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth, <a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> or saith he it assuredly for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, to thresh in hope of partaking. <a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things? <a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> If others partake of this right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ. <a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Know ye not that they that minister about sacred things eat of the things of the temple, and they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar? <a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel. <a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for it were good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorifying void. <a id="c9_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel. <a id="c9_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me. <a id="c9_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel. <a id="c9_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For though I was free from all men, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more. <a id="c9_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; <a id="c9_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law. <a id="c9_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some. <a id="c9_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And I do all things for the gospelâ€™s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof. <a id="c9_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Know ye not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain. <a id="c9_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And every man that striveth in the games exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. <a id="c9_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air: <a id="c9_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.</p>
