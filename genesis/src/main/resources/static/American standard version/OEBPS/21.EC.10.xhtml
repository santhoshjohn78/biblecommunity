<h2>Ecclesiastes 10</h2>

<p><a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor; so doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor. <a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left. <a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Yea also, when the fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool. <a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for gentleness allayeth great offences. <a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler: <a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place. <a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking like servants upon the earth. <a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a wall, a serpent shall bite him. <a id="c10_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby. <a id="c10_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. <a id="c10_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> If the serpent bite before it is charmed, then is there no advantage in the charmer. <a id="c10_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. <a id="c10_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. <a id="c10_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> A fool also multiplieth words: yet man knoweth not what shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can tell him? <a id="c10_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The labor of fools wearieth every one of them; for he knoweth not how to go to the city. <a id="c10_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! <a id="c10_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! <a id="c10_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> By slothfulness the roof sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh. <a id="c10_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life; and money answereth all things. <a id="c10_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Revile not the king, no, not in thy thought; and revile not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the heavens shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</p>
