<h2>Galatians 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead), <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and all the brethren that are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father: <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel; <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> which is not another gospel only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema. <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> As we have said before, so say I now again, if any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema. <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ. <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ. <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it: <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, even from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace, <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood: <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus. <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days. <a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother. <a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. <a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Then I came unto the regions of Syria and Cilicia. <a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: <a id="c1_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc; <a id="c1_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and they glorified God in me.</p>
