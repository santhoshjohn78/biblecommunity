<h2>Titus 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine: <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience: <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good; <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed: <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded: <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing to them in all things; not gainsaying; <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men, <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world; <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p>
