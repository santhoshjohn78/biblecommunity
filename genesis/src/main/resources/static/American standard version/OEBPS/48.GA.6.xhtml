<h2>Galatians 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted. <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Bear ye one anotherâ€™s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> But let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not of his neighbor. <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For each man shall bear his own burden. <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life. <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith. <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> See with how large letters I write unto you with mine own hand. <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. <a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world. <a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. <a id="c6_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. <a id="c6_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Henceforth, let no man trouble me; for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus. <a id="c6_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</p>
