<h2>1 Corinthians 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able to bear it: nay, not even now are ye able; <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men? <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men? <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For we are God’s fellow-workers: ye are God’s husbandry, God’s building. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon. <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble; <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise. <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness: <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise that they are vain. <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours; <a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; <a id="c3_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.</p>
