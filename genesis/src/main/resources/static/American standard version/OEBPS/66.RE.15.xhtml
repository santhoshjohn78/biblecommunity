<h2>Revelation 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues, which are the last, for in them is finished the wrath of God. <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass, having harps of God. <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all the nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: <a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and there came out from the temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with precious stone, pure <a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. <a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.</p>
