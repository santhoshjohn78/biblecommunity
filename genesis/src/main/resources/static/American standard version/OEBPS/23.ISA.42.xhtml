<h2>Isaiah 42</h2>

<p><a id="c42_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Behold, my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen, in whom my soul delighteth: I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the Gentiles. <a id="c42_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> He will not cry, nor lift up his voice, nor cause it to be heard in the street. <a id="c42_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> A bruised reed will he not break, and a dimly burning wick will he not quench: he will bring forth justice in truth. <a id="c42_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He will not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set justice in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law. <a id="c42_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thus saith God Jehovah, he that created the heavens, and stretched them forth; he that spread abroad the earth and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein: <a id="c42_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I, Jehovah, have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thy hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; <a id="c42_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house. <a id="c42_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise unto graven images. <a id="c42_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them. <a id="c42_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Sing unto Jehovah a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth; ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles, and the inhabitants thereof. <a id="c42_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of Sela sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. <a id="c42_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Let them give glory unto Jehovah, and declare his praise in the islands. <a id="c42_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Jehovah will go forth as a mighty man; he will stir up his zeal like a man of war: he will cry, yea, he will shout aloud; he will do mightily against his enemies. <a id="c42_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry out like a travailing woman; I will gasp and pant together. <a id="c42_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools. <a id="c42_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not; in paths that they know not will I lead them; I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These things will I do, and I will not forsake them. <a id="c42_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> They shall be turned back, they shall be utterly put to shame, that trust in graven images, that say unto molten images, Ye are our gods. <a id="c42_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see. <a id="c42_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I send? who is blind as he that is at peace with me, and blind as Jehovah’s servant? <a id="c42_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Thou seest many things, but thou observest not; his ears are open, but he heareth not. <a id="c42_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> It pleased Jehovah, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the law, and make it honorable. <a id="c42_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But this is a people robbed and plundered; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison-houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore. <a id="c42_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Who is there among you that will give ear to this? that will hearken and hear for the time to come? <a id="c42_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not Jehovah? he against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient unto his law. <a id="c42_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Therefore he poured upon him the fierceness of his anger, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</p>
