<h2>Isaiah 18</h2>

<p><a id="c18_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia; <a id="c18_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> that sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people terrible from their beginning onward, a nation that meteth out and treadeth down, whose land the rivers divide! <a id="c18_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> All ye inhabitants of the world, and ye dwellers on the earth, when an ensign is lifted up on the mountains, see ye; and when the trumpet is blown, hear ye. <a id="c18_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For thus hath Jehovah said unto me, I will be still, and I will behold in my dwelling-place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. <a id="c18_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becometh a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks, and the spreading branches will he take away and cut down. <a id="c18_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> They shall be left together unto the ravenous birds of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth; and the ravenous birds shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them. <a id="c18_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> In that time shall a present be brought unto Jehovah of hosts from a people tall and smooth, even from a people terrible from their beginning onward, a nation that meteth out and treadeth down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of Jehovah of hosts, the mount Zion.</p>
