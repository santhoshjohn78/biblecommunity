<h2>Genesis 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> After these things the word of Jehovah came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward. <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Abram said, O Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus? <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And, behold, the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, This man shall not be thine heir; But he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. <a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he believed in Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness. <a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And he said unto him, I am Jehovah that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it. <a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he said, O Lord Jehovah, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? <a id="c15_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he said unto him, Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon. <a id="c15_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other: but the birds divided he not. <a id="c15_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him. <a id="c15_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; <a id="c15_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. <a id="c15_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. <a id="c15_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full. <a id="c15_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces. <a id="c15_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: <a id="c15_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite, <a id="c15_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim, <a id="c15_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.</p>
