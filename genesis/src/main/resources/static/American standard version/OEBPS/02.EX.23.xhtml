<h2>Exodus 23</h2>

<p><a id="c23_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Thou shalt not take up a false report: put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. <a id="c23_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to wrest <a id="c23_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> neither shalt thou favor a poor man in his cause.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. <a id="c23_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, thou shalt forbear to leave him, thou shalt surely release</p>

<p><a id="c23_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thou shalt not wrest the justice due to thy poor in his cause. <a id="c23_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked. <a id="c23_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And thou shalt take no bribe: for a bribe blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous. <a id="c23_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And a sojourner shalt thou not oppress: for ye know the heart of a sojourner, seeing ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the increase thereof: <a id="c23_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard. <a id="c23_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner, may be refreshed. <a id="c23_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. <a id="c23_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it thou camest out from Egypt); and none shall appear before me empty: <a id="c23_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labors, which thou sowest in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field. <a id="c23_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning. <a id="c23_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. <a id="c23_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Take ye heed before him, and hearken unto his voice; provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgression: for my name is in him. <a id="c23_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. <a id="c23_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: and I will cut them off. <a id="c23_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars. <a id="c23_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And ye shall serve Jehovah your God, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. <a id="c23_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> There shall none cast her young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil. <a id="c23_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> I will send my terror before thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. <a id="c23_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. <a id="c23_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee. <a id="c23_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land. <a id="c23_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand: and thou shalt drive them out before thee. <a id="c23_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. <a id="c23_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.</p>
