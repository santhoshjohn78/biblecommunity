<h2>Psalms 76</h2>

<p><a id="c76_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In Judah is God known: His name is great in Israel. <a id="c76_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> In Salem also is his tabernacle, And his dwelling-place in Zion. <a id="c76_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> There he brake the arrows of the bow; The shield, and the sword, and the battle.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Glorious art thou and excellent, From the mountains of prey. <a id="c76_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The stouthearted are made a spoil, They have slept their sleep; And none of the men of might have found their hands. <a id="c76_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep. <a id="c76_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Thou, even thou, art to be feared; And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? <a id="c76_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still, <a id="c76_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee. <a id="c76_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Vow, and pay unto Jehovah your God: Let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. <a id="c76_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> He will cut off the spirit of princes: He is terrible to the kings of the earth.</p>
