<h2>Psalms 116</h2>

<p><a id="c116_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I love Jehovah, because he heareth My voice and my supplications. <a id="c116_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. <a id="c116_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The cords of death compassed me, And the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. <a id="c116_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then called I upon the name of Jehovah: O Jehovah, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. <a id="c116_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous; Yea, our God is merciful. <a id="c116_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Jehovah preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me. <a id="c116_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Return unto thy rest, O my soul; For Jehovah hath dealt bountifully with thee. <a id="c116_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For thou hast delivered my soul from death, Mine eyes from tears, And my feet from falling. <a id="c116_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I will walk before Jehovah In the land of the living. <a id="c116_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I believe, for I will speak: I was greatly afflicted: <a id="c116_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> I said in my haste, All men are liars. <a id="c116_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> What shall I render unto Jehovah For all his benefits toward me? <a id="c116_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I will take the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of Jehovah. <a id="c116_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people. <a id="c116_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Precious in the sight of Jehovah Is the death of his saints. <a id="c116_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> O Jehovah, truly I am thy servant: I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bonds. <a id="c116_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of Jehovah. <a id="c116_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people, <a id="c116_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> In the courts of Jehovahâ€™s house, In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.</p>
