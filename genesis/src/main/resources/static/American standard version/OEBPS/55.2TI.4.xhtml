<h2>2 Timothy 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I charge thee in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts; <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith: <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Give diligence to come shortly unto me: <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering. <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works: <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account. <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. <a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. <a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick. <a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Give diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. <a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.</p>
