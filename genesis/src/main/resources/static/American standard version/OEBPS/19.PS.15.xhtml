<h2>Psalms 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill? <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, And speaketh truth in his heart; <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He that slandereth not with his tongue, Nor doeth evil to his friend, Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor; <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honoreth them that fear Jehovah; He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not; <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He that putteth not out his money to interest, Nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.</p>
