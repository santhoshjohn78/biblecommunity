<h2>Psalms 120</h2>

<p><a id="c120_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In my distress I cried unto Jehovah, And he answered me. <a id="c120_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Deliver my soul, O Jehovah, from lying lips, And from a deceitful tongue. <a id="c120_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> What shall be given unto thee, and what shall be done more unto thee, Thou deceitful tongue? <a id="c120_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Sharp arrows of the mighty, With coals of juniper. <a id="c120_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, That I dwell among the tents of Kedar! <a id="c120_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> My soul hath long had her dwelling With him that hateth peace. <a id="c120_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I am for peace: But when I speak, they are for war.</p>
