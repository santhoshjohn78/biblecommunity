<h2>Psalms 43</h2>

<p><a id="c43_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: Oh deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man. <a id="c43_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou cast me off? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? <a id="c43_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Oh send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me: Let them bring me unto thy holy hill, And to thy tabernacles. <a id="c43_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then will I go unto the altar of God, Unto God my exceeding joy; And upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God. <a id="c43_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, Who is the help of my countenance, and my God.</p>
