<h2>1 Samuel 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba. <a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah; <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and they said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah. <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Jehovah said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them. <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit thou shalt protest solemnly unto them, and shalt show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Samuel told all the words of Jehovah unto the people that asked of him a king. <a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots; <a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and he will set some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots. <a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. <a id="c8_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. <a id="c8_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. <a id="c8_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. <a id="c8_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants. <a id="c8_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you; and Jehovah will not answer you in that day.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay: but we will have a king over us, <a id="c8_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. <a id="c8_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Jehovah. <a id="c8_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.</p>
