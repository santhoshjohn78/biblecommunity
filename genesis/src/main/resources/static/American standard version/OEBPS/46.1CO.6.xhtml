<h2>1 Corinthians 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints? <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life? <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church? <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I say this to move you to shame. What, cannot there be found among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren, <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers? <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded? <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God. <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any. <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body: <a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up as through his power. <a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid. <a id="c6_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh. <a id="c6_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. <a id="c6_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. <a id="c6_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own; <a id="c6_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body.</p>
