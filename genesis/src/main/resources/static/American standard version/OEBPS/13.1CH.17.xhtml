<h2>1 Chronicles 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah dwelleth under curtains. <a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee. <a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, <a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in: <a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from <a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar? <a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel: <a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. <a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first, <a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house. <a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. <a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. <a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee; <a id="c17_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever. <a id="c17_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far? <a id="c17_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God. <a id="c17_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> What can David say yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. <a id="c17_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> O Jehovah, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all <a id="c17_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. <a id="c17_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemest out of Egypt? <a id="c17_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God. <a id="c17_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken. <a id="c17_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee. <a id="c17_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray before thee. <a id="c17_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And now, O Jehovah, thou art God, and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant: <a id="c17_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever.</p>
