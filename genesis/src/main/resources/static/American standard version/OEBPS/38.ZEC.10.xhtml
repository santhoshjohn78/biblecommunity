<h2>Zechariah 10</h2>

<p><a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Ask ye of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain, even of Jehovah that maketh lightnings; and he will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field. <a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie; and they have told false dreams, they comfort in vain: therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. <a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for Jehovah of hosts hath visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as his goodly horse in the battle. <a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> From him shall come forth the corner-stone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together. <a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And they shall be as mighty men, treading down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle; and they shall fight, because Jehovah is with them; and the riders on horses shall be confounded. <a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back; for I have mercy upon them; and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am Jehovah their God, and I will hear them. <a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine; yea, their children shall see it, and rejoice; their heart shall be glad in Jehovah. <a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them; and they shall increase as they have increased. <a id="c10_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And I will sow them among the peoples; and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and shall return. <a id="c10_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them. <a id="c10_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And he will pass through the sea of affliction, and will smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart. <a id="c10_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I will strengthen them in Jehovah; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith Jehovah.</p>
