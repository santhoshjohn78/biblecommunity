<h2>Ezekiel 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee. <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And the Spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me. <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the children are impudent and stiffhearted: I do sent thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</p>
