<h2>2 Corinthians 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth), <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in my weaknesses. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me to be, or heareth from me. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. <a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. <a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christâ€™s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. <a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing. <a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works. <a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except it be that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong. <a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. <a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less? <a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile. <a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you? <a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? <a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, <a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means there should be strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults; <a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> lest again when I come my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.</p>
