<h2>Nehemiah 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire. <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven, <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments: <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my fatherâ€™s house have sinned: <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples: <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> but if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there. <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was cupbearer to the king.</p>
