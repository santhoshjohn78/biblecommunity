<h2>Ephesians 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,-- <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward; <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words, <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ; <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> to wit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all things; <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God, <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Wherefore I ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you, which are your glory. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man; <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> unto him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
