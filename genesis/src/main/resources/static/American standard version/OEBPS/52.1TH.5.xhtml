<h2>1 Thessalonians 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape. <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief: <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness; <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For they that sleep sleep in the night: and they that are drunken are drunken in the night. <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For God appointed us not into wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their workâ€™s sake. Be at peace among yourselves. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all. <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all. <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Rejoice always; <a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> pray without ceasing; <a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward. <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Quench not the Spirit; <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> despise not prophesyings; <a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> prove all things; hold fast that which is good; <a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> abstain from every form of evil. <a id="c5_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. <a id="c5_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it. <a id="c5_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Brethren, pray for us. <a id="c5_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss. <a id="c5_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren. <a id="c5_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</p>
