<h2>Psalms 21</h2>

<p><a id="c21_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The king shall joy in thy strength, O Jehovah; And in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! <a id="c21_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thou hast given him his heartâ€™s desire, And hast not withholden the request of his lips.</p>

<p><a id="c21_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For thou meetest him with the blessings of goodness: Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head. <a id="c21_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He asked life of thee, thou gavest it him, Even length of days for ever and ever. <a id="c21_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> His glory is great in thy salvation: Honor and majesty dost thou lay upon him. <a id="c21_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For thou makest him most blessed for ever: Thou makest him glad with joy in thy presence. <a id="c21_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For the king trusteth in Jehovah; And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he shall not be moved. <a id="c21_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Thy hand will find out all thine enemies; Thy right hand will find out those that hate thee. <a id="c21_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Thou wilt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger: Jehovah will swallow them up in his wrath, And the fire shall devour them. <a id="c21_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Their fruit wilt thou destroy from the earth, And their seed from among the children of men. <a id="c21_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For they intended evil against thee; They conceived a device which they are not able to perform. <a id="c21_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For thou wilt make them turn their back; Thou wilt make ready with thy bowstrings against their face. <a id="c21_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Be thou exalted, O Jehovah, in thy strength: So will we sing and praise thy power.</p>
