<h2>Ecclesiastes 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also was vanity. <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it? <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards; <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit; <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared; <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem; <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and that of all sorts. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion from all my labor. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The wise manâ€™s eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity. <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool! <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind. <a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me. <a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity. <a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun. <a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. <a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun? <a id="c2_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> For all his days are but sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity. <a id="c2_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God. <a id="c2_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I? <a id="c2_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For to the man that pleaseth him God giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
