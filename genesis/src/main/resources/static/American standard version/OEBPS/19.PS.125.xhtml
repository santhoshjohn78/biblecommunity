<h2>Psalms 125</h2>

<p><a id="c125_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> They that trust in Jehovah Are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever. <a id="c125_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, So Jehovah is round about his people From this time forth and for evermore. <a id="c125_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; That the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity. <a id="c125_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Do good, O Jehovah, unto those that are good, And to them that are upright in their hearts. <a id="c125_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, Jehovah will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.</p>
