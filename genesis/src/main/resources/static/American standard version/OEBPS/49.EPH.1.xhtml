<h2>Ephesians 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints that are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus: <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love: <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved: <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> making known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth; in him, I say, <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> in whom also we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will; <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ: <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation,-- in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> which is an earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of Godâ€™s own possession, unto the praise of his glory. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which ye show toward all the saints, <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, <a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might <a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places, <a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: <a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church, <a id="c1_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</p>
