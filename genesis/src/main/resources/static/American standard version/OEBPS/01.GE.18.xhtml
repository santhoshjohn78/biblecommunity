<h2>Genesis 18</h2>

<p><a id="c18_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; <a id="c18_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth, <a id="c18_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: <a id="c18_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: <a id="c18_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. <a id="c18_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes. <a id="c18_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it. <a id="c18_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. <a id="c18_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him. <a id="c18_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Now Abraham and Sarah were old, and well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. <a id="c18_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? <a id="c18_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old? <a id="c18_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son. <a id="c18_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. <a id="c18_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do; <a id="c18_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> seeing that Abraham had surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? <a id="c18_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. <a id="c18_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; <a id="c18_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah. <a id="c18_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked? <a id="c18_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? <a id="c18_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? <a id="c18_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake. <a id="c18_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes: <a id="c18_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five. <a id="c18_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty’s sake. <a id="c18_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. <a id="c18_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake. <a id="c18_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake. <a id="c18_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</p>
