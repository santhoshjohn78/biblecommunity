<h2>1 Corinthians 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth. <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know; <a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him. <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no God but one. <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many; <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him. <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better. <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak. <a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idolâ€™s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? <a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died. <a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ. <a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble.</p>
