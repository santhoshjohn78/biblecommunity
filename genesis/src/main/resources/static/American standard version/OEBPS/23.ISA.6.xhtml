<h2>Isaiah 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts. <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin forgiven. <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me. <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed. <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste, <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land. <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And if there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock thereof.</p>
