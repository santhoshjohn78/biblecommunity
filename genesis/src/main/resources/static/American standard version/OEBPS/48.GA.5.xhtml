<h2>Galatians 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Ye are severed from Christ, ye would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Ye were running well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth? <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> This persuasion came not of him that calleth you. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision. <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only use not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> But I say, walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. <a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would. <a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law. <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties, <a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. <a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <a id="c5_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> meekness, self-control; against such there is no law. <a id="c5_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof. <a id="c5_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk. <a id="c5_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.</p>
