<h2>Psalms 111</h2>

<p><a id="c111_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise ye Jehovah. I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart, In the council of the upright, and in the congregation. <a id="c111_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The works of Jehovah are great, Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. <a id="c111_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> His work is honor and majesty; And his righteousness endureth for ever. <a id="c111_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: Jehovah is gracious and merciful. <a id="c111_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He hath given food unto them that fear him: He will ever be mindful of his covenant. <a id="c111_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He hath showed his people the power of his works, In giving them the heritage of the nations. <a id="c111_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The works of his hands are truth and justice; All his precepts are sure. <a id="c111_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> They are established for ever and ever; They are done in truth and uprightness. <a id="c111_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He hath sent redemption unto his people; He hath commanded his covenant for ever: Holy and reverend is his name. <a id="c111_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all they that do his commandments: His praise endureth for ever.</p>
