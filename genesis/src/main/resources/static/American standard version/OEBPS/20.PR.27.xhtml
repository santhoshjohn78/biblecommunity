<h2>Proverbs 27</h2>

<p><a id="c27_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Boast not thyself of tomorrow; For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. <a id="c27_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; A stranger, and not thine own lips. <a id="c27_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; But a fool’s vexation is heavier than they both. <a id="c27_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; But who is able to stand before jealousy? <a id="c27_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Better is open rebuke Than love that is hidden. <a id="c27_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Faithful are the wounds of a friend; But the kisses of an enemy are profuse. <a id="c27_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The full soul loatheth a honeycomb; But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. <a id="c27_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> As a bird that wandereth from her nest, So is a man that wandereth from his place. <a id="c27_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Oil and perfume rejoice the heart; So doth the sweetness of a man’s friend that cometh of hearty counsel. <a id="c27_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; And go not to thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity: Better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off. <a id="c27_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, That I may answer him that reproacheth me. <a id="c27_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself; But the simple pass on, and suffer for it. <a id="c27_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge that is surety for a foreign woman. <a id="c27_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, It shall be counted a curse to him. <a id="c27_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> A continual dropping in a very rainy day And a contentious woman are alike: <a id="c27_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> He that would restrain her restraineth the wind; And his right hand encountereth oil. <a id="c27_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Iron sharpeneth iron; So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. <a id="c27_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Whoso keepeth the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof; And he that regardeth his master shall be honored. <a id="c27_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> As in water face answereth to face, So the heart of man to man. <a id="c27_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; And the eyes of man are never satisfied. <a id="c27_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; And a man is tried by his praise. <a id="c27_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with bruised grain, Yet will not his foolishness depart from him.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, And look well to thy herds: <a id="c27_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> For riches are not for ever: And doth the crown endure unto all generations? <a id="c27_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The hay is carried, and the tender grass showeth itself, And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in. <a id="c27_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> The lambs are for thy clothing, And the goats are the price of the field; <a id="c27_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And there will be goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, And maintenance for thy maidens.</p>
