<h2>Isaiah 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for Jehovah hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his masterâ€™s crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that deal corruptly! they have forsaken Jehovah, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are estranged and gone backward. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Why will ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil. <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Except Jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah. <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> What unto me is the multitude of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah: I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts? <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies,- I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting. <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I am weary of bearing them. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood. <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Come now, and let us reason together, saith Jehovah: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. <a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: <a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it. <a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> How is the faithful city become a harlot! she that was full of justice! righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers. <a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water. <a id="c1_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them. <a id="c1_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Therefore saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies; <a id="c1_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin; <a id="c1_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, a faithful town. <a id="c1_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness. <a id="c1_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and they that forsake Jehovah shall be consumed. <a id="c1_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. <a id="c1_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water. <a id="c1_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</p>
