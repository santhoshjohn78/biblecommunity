<h2>Proverbs 28</h2>

<p><a id="c28_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The wicked flee when no man pursueth; But the righteous are bold as a lion. <a id="c28_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof; But by men of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged. <a id="c28_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> A needy man that oppresseth the poor Is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. <a id="c28_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> They that forsake the law praise the wicked; But such as keep the law contend with them. <a id="c28_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Evil men understand not justice; But they that seek Jehovah understand all things. <a id="c28_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich. <a id="c28_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son; But he that is a companion of gluttons shameth his father. <a id="c28_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He that augmenteth his substance by interest and increase, Gathereth it for him that hath pity on the poor. <a id="c28_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer is an abomination. <a id="c28_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way, He shall fall himself into his own pit; But the perfect shall inherit good. <a id="c28_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The rich man is wise in his own conceit; But the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. <a id="c28_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves. <a id="c28_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper: But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy. <a id="c28_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Happy is the man that feareth alway; But he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. <a id="c28_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear, So is a wicked ruler over a poor people. <a id="c28_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The prince that lacketh understanding is also a great oppressor; But he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. <a id="c28_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> A man that is laden with the blood of any person Shall flee unto the pit; let no man stay him. <a id="c28_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Whoso walketh uprightly shall be delivered; But he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. <a id="c28_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread; But he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough. <a id="c28_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> A faithful man shall abound with blessings; But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished. <a id="c28_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> To have respect of persons is not good; Neither that a man should transgress for a piece of bread. <a id="c28_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> he that hath an evil eye hasteth after riches, And knoweth not that want shall come upon him. <a id="c28_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> He that rebuketh a man shall afterward find more favor Than he that flattereth with the tongue. <a id="c28_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression, The same is the companion of a destroyer. <a id="c28_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> He that is of a greedy spirit stirreth up strife; But he that putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be made fat. <a id="c28_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool; But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. <a id="c28_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack; But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. <a id="c28_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; But when they perish, the righteous increase.</p>
