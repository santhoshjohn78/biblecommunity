<h2>2 Corinthians 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow. <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad but he that is made sorry by me? <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly unto you. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many; <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Wherefore I beseech you to confirm your love toward him. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord, <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish; <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> to the one a savor from death unto death; to the other a savor from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.</p>
