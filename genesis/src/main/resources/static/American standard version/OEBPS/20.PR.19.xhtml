<h2>Proverbs 19</h2>

<p><a id="c19_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity Than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool. <a id="c19_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Also, that the soul be without knowledge is not good; And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth. <a id="c19_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The foolishness of man subverteth his way; And his heart fretteth against Jehovah. <a id="c19_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Wealth addeth many friends; But the poor is separated from his friend. <a id="c19_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that uttereth lies shall not escape. <a id="c19_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Many will entreat the favor of the liberal man; And every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts. <a id="c19_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> All the brethren of the poor do hate him: How much more do his friends go far from him! He pursueth them with words, but they are gone. <a id="c19_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: He that keepeth understanding shall find good. <a id="c19_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that uttereth lies shall perish. <a id="c19_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Delicate living is not seemly for a fool; Much less for a servant to have rule over princes. <a id="c19_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The discretion of a man maketh him slow to anger; And it is his glory to pass over a transgression. <a id="c19_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; But his favor is as dew upon the grass. <a id="c19_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> A foolish son is the calamity of his father; And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping. <a id="c19_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> House and riches are an inheritance from fathers; But a prudent wife is from Jehovah. <a id="c19_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; And the idle soul shall suffer hunger. <a id="c19_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul; But he that is careless of his ways shall die. <a id="c19_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto Jehovah, And his good deed will he pay him again. <a id="c19_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Chasten thy son, seeing there is hope; and set not thy heart on his destruction. <a id="c19_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> A man of great wrath shall bear the penalty; For if thou deliver him, thou must do it yet again. <a id="c19_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, That thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. <a id="c19_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> There are many devices in a man’s heart; But the counsel of Jehovah, that shall stand. <a id="c19_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> That which maketh a man to be desired is his kindness; And a poor man is better than a liar. <a id="c19_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The fear of Jehovah tendeth to life; And he that hath it shall abide satisfied; He shall not be visited with evil. <a id="c19_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish, And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. <a id="c19_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Smite a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; And reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge. <a id="c19_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> He that doeth violence to his father, and chaseth away his mother, Is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach. <a id="c19_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Cease, my son, to hear instruction Only to err from the words of knowledge. <a id="c19_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> A worthless witness mocketh at justice; And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity. <a id="c19_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Judgments are prepared for scoffers, And stripes for the back of fools.</p>
