<h2>Exodus 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah: <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah I was not known to them. <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned. <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments: <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I will bring you in unto the land which I sware to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am Jehovah. <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Moses spake before Jehovah, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> These are the heads of their fathers’ houses. The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben. <a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman; these are the families of Simeon. <a id="c6_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years. <a id="c6_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families. <a id="c6_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years. <a id="c6_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. <a id="c6_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Amram took him Jochebed his father’s sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years. <a id="c6_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. <a id="c6_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri. <a id="c6_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Aaron took him Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. <a id="c6_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And the sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites. <a id="c6_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Eleazar Aaron’s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites according to their families. <a id="c6_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts. <a id="c6_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> These are they that spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And it came to pass on the day when Jehovah spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, <a id="c6_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> that Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, I am Jehovah: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee. <a id="c6_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Moses said before Jehovah, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?</p>
