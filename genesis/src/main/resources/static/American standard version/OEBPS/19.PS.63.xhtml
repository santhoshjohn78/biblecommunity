<h2>Psalms 63</h2>

<p><a id="c63_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> O God, thou art my God; earnestly will I seek thee: My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, In a dry and weary land, where no water is. <a id="c63_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary, To see thy power and thy glory. <a id="c63_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, My lips shall praise thee. <a id="c63_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> So will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name. <a id="c63_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips; <a id="c63_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> When I remember thee upon my bed, And meditate on thee in the night-watches. <a id="c63_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For thou hast been my help, And in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. <a id="c63_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> My soul followeth hard after thee: Thy right hand upholdeth me. <a id="c63_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, Shall go into the lower parts of the earth. <a id="c63_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> They shall be given over to the power of the sword: They shall be a portion for foxes. <a id="c63_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But the king shall rejoice in God: Every one that sweareth by him shall glory; For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.</p>
