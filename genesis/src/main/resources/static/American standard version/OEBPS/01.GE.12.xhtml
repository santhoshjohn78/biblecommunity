<h2>Genesis 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto the land that I will show thee: <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing; <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed. <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> So Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah. <a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land. <a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: <a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. <a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee. <a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. <a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. <a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels. <a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. <a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? <a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. <a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.</p>
