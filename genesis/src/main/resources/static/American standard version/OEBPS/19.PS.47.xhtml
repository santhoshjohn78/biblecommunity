<h2>Psalms 47</h2>

<p><a id="c47_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Oh clap your hands, all ye peoples; Shout unto God with the voice of triumph. <a id="c47_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For Jehovah Most High is terrible; He is a great King over all the earth. <a id="c47_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He subdueth peoples under us, And nations under our feet. <a id="c47_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He chooseth our inheritance for us, The glory of Jacob whom he loved.</p>

<p><a id="c47_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> God is gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet. <a id="c47_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Sing praise to God, sing praises: Sing praises unto our King, sing praises. <a id="c47_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For God is the King of all the earth: Sing ye praises with understanding. <a id="c47_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> God reigneth over the nations: God sitteth upon his holy throne. <a id="c47_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The princes of the peoples are gathered together To be the people of the God of Abraham: For the shields of the earth belong unto God; He is greatly exalted.</p>
