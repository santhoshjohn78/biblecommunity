<h2>Psalms 98</h2>

<p><a id="c98_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song; For he hath done marvellous things: His right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought salvation for him. <a id="c98_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah hath made known his salvation: His righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the nations. <a id="c98_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He hath remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. <a id="c98_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all the earth: Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises. <a id="c98_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Sing praises unto Jehovah with the harp; With the harp and the voice of melody. <a id="c98_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> With trumpets and sound of cornet Make a joyful noise before the King, Jehovah. <a id="c98_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein; <a id="c98_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Let the floods clap their hands; Let the hills sing for joy together <a id="c98_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Before Jehovah; for he cometh to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with equity.</p>
