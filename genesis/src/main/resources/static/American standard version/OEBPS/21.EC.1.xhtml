<h2>Ecclesiastes 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> What profit hath man of all his labor wherein he laboreth under the sun? <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth for ever. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind returneth again to its circuits. <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been long ago, in the ages which were before us. <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> There is no remembrance of the former generations; neither shall there be any remembrance of the latter generations that are to come, among those that shall come after. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith. <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind. <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</p>
