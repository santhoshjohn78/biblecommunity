<h2>Amos 9</h2>

<p><a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I saw the Lord standing beside the altar: and he said, Smite the capitals, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape. <a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Though they dig into Sheol, thence shall my hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down. <a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them. <a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good. <a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, is he that toucheth the land and it melteth, and all that dwell therein shall mourn; and it shall rise up wholly like the River, and shall sink again, like the River of Egypt; <a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> it is he that buildeth his chambers in the heavens, and hath founded his vault upon the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; Jehovah is his name. <a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith Jehovah. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir? <a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; save that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith Jehovah. <a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like as grain is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least kernel fall upon the earth. <a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, The evil shall not overtake nor meet us. <a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old; <a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations that are called by my name, saith Jehovah that doeth this. <a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt. <a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them. <a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, saith Jehovah thy God.</p>
