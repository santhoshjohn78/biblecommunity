<h2>Psalms 100</h2>

<p><a id="c100_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all ye lands. <a id="c100_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Serve Jehovah with gladness: Come before his presence with singing. <a id="c100_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Know ye that Jehovah, he is God: It is he that hath made us, and we are his; We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. <a id="c100_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, And into his courts with praise: Give thanks unto him, and bless his name. <a id="c100_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For Jehovah is good; his lovingkindness endureth for ever, And his faithfulness unto all generations.</p>
