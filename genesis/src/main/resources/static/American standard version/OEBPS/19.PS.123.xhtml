<h2>Psalms 123</h2>

<p><a id="c123_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unto thee do I lift up mine eyes, O thou that sittest in the heavens. <a id="c123_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid unto the hand of her mistress; So our eyes look unto Jehovah our God, Until he have mercy upon us. <a id="c123_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Have mercy upon us, O Jehovah, have mercy upon us; For we are exceedingly filled with contempt. <a id="c123_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Our soul is exceedingly filled With the scoffing of those that are at ease, And with the contempt of the proud.</p>
