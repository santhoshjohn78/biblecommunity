<h2>Proverbs 25</h2>

<p><a id="c25_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; But the glory of kings is to search out a matter. <a id="c25_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, So the heart of kings is unsearchable. <a id="c25_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Take away the dross from the silver, And there cometh forth a vessel for the refiner: <a id="c25_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Take away the wicked from before the king, And his throne shall be established in righteousness. <a id="c25_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Put not thyself forward in the presence of the king, And stand not in the place of great men: <a id="c25_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For better is it that it be said unto thee, Come up hither, Than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince, Whom thine eyes have seen. <a id="c25_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Go not forth hastily to strive, Lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, When thy neighbor hath put thee to shame. <a id="c25_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Debate thy cause with thy neighbor himself, And disclose not the secret of another; <a id="c25_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Lest he that heareth it revile thee, And thine infamy turn not away. <a id="c25_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> A word fitly spoken Is like apples of gold in network of silver. <a id="c25_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, So is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. <a id="c25_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, So is a faithful messenger to them that send him; For he refresheth the soul of his masters. <a id="c25_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> As clouds and wind without rain, So is he that boasteth himself of his gifts falsely. <a id="c25_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> By long forbearing is a ruler persuaded, And a soft tongue breaketh the bone. <a id="c25_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, Lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. <a id="c25_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Let thy foot be seldom in thy neighborâ€™s house, Lest he be weary of thee, and hate thee. <a id="c25_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> A man that beareth false witness against his neighbor Is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. <a id="c25_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble Is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. <a id="c25_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> As one that taketh off a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon soda, So is he that singeth songs to a heavy heart. <a id="c25_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; And if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: <a id="c25_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For thou wilt heap coals of fire upon his head, And Jehovah will reward thee. <a id="c25_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The north wind bringeth forth rain: So doth a backbiting tongue an angry countenance. <a id="c25_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, Than with a contentious woman in a wide house. <a id="c25_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> As cold waters to a thirsty soul, So is good news from a far country. <a id="c25_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> As a troubled fountain, and a corrupted spring, So is a righteous man that giveth way before the wicked. <a id="c25_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> It is not good to eat much honey: So for men to search out their own glory is grievous. <a id="c25_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> He whose spirit is without restraint Is like a city that is broken down and without walls.</p>
