<h2>Galatians 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified? <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> This only would I learn from you. Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh? <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Know therefore that they that are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham, <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> So then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them. <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Now that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith; <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise. <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; and it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Now a mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one. <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law. <a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But the scriptures shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. <a id="c3_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. <a id="c3_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> So that the law is become our tutor to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. <a id="c3_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> But now faith that is come, we are no longer under a tutor. <a id="c3_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus. <a id="c3_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ. <a id="c3_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one <a id="c3_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.</p>
