<h2>Psalms 131</h2>

<p><a id="c131_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; Neither do I exercise myself in great matters, Or in things too wonderful for me. <a id="c131_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul; Like a weaned child with his mother, Like a weaned child is my soul within me. <a id="c131_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> O Israel, hope in Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore.</p>
