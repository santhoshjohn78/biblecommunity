<h2>Proverbs 10</h2>

<p><a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The proverbs of Solomon.</p>

<p>A wise son maketh a glad father; But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother. <a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Treasures of wickedness profit nothing; But righteousness delivereth from death. <a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jehovah will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish; But he thrusteth away the desire of the wicked. <a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He becometh poor that worketh with a slack hand; But the hand of the diligent maketh rich. <a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He that gathereth in summer is a wise son; But he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame. <a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Blessings are upon the head of the righteous; But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. <a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The memory of the righteous is blessed; But the name of the wicked shall rot. <a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The wise in heart will receive commandments; But a prating fool shall fall. <a id="c10_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He that walketh uprightly walketh surely; But he that perverteth his ways shall be known. <a id="c10_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow; But a prating fool shall fall. <a id="c10_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life; But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. <a id="c10_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Hatred stirreth up strifes; But love covereth all transgressions. <a id="c10_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> In the lips of him that hath discernment wisdom is found; But a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding. <a id="c10_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Wise men lay up knowledge; But the mouth of the foolish is a present destruction. <a id="c10_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The rich manâ€™s wealth is his strong city: The destruction of the poor is their poverty. <a id="c10_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The labor of the righteous tendeth to life; The increase of the wicked, to sin. <a id="c10_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He is in the way of life that heedeth correction; But he that forsaketh reproof erreth. <a id="c10_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> He that hideth hatred is of lying lips; And he that uttereth a slander is a fool. <a id="c10_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression; But he that refraineth his lips doeth wisely. <a id="c10_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> The tongue of the righteous is as choice silver: The heart of the wicked is little worth. <a id="c10_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> The lips of the righteous feed many; But the foolish die for lack of understanding. <a id="c10_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> The blessing of Jehovah, it maketh rich; And he addeth no sorrow therewith. <a id="c10_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> It is as sport to a fool to do wickedness; And so is wisdom to a man of understanding. <a id="c10_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him; And the desire of the righteous shall be granted. <a id="c10_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> When the whirlwind passeth, the wicked is no more; But the righteous is an everlasting foundation. <a id="c10_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, So is the sluggard to them that send him. <a id="c10_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The fear of Jehovah prolongeth days; But the years of the wicked shall be shortened. <a id="c10_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> The hope of the righteous shall be gladness; But the expectation of the wicked shall perish. <a id="c10_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> The way of Jehovah is a stronghold to the upright; But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. <a id="c10_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> The righteous shall never be removed; But the wicked shall not dwell in the land. <a id="c10_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> The mouth of the righteous bringeth forth wisdom; But the perverse tongue shall be cut off. <a id="c10_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable; But the mouth of the wicked speaketh perverseness.</p>
