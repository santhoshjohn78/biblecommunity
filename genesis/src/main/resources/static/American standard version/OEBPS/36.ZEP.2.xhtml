<h2>Zephaniah 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation that hath no shame; <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah’s anger come upon you. <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Seek ye Jehovah, all ye meek of the earth, that have kept his ordinances; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye will be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the sea-coast shall be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed their flocks thereupon; in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for Jehovah their God will visit them, and bring back their captivity. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Therefore as I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall make a prey of them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Jehovah will be terrible unto them; for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the nations. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword. <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall lodge in the capitals thereof; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he hath laid bare the cedar-work. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> This is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.</p>
