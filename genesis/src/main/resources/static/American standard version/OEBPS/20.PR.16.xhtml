<h2>Proverbs 16</h2>

<p><a id="c16_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The plans of the heart belong to man; But the answer of the tongue is from Jehovah. <a id="c16_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; But Jehovah weigheth the spirits. <a id="c16_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Commit thy works unto Jehovah, And thy purposes shall be established. <a id="c16_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Jehovah hath made everything for its own end; Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. <a id="c16_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to Jehovah: Though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished. <a id="c16_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for; And by the fear of Jehovah men depart from evil. <a id="c16_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> When a man’s ways please Jehovah, He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. <a id="c16_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Better is a little, with righteousness, Than great revenues with injustice. <a id="c16_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> A man’s heart deviseth his way; But Jehovah directeth his steps. <a id="c16_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> A divine sentence is in the lips of the king; His mouth shall not transgress in judgment. <a id="c16_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> A just balance and scales are Jehovah’s; All the weights of the bag are his work. <a id="c16_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness; For the throne is established by righteousness. <a id="c16_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Righteous lips are the delight of kings; And they love him that speaketh right. <a id="c16_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The wrath of a king is as messengers of death; But a wise man will pacify it. <a id="c16_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> In the light of the king’s countenance is life; And his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain. <a id="c16_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! Yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver. <a id="c16_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: He that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. <a id="c16_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Pride goeth before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall. <a id="c16_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Better it is to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, Than to divide the spoil with the proud. <a id="c16_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> He that giveth heed unto the word shall find good; And whoso trusteth in Jehovah, happy is he. <a id="c16_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> The wise in heart shall be called prudent; And the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. <a id="c16_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Understanding is a well-spring of life unto him that hath it; But the correction of fools is their folly. <a id="c16_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The heart of the wise instructeth his mouth, And addeth learning to his lips. <a id="c16_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Pleasant words are as a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. <a id="c16_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, But the end thereof are the ways of death. <a id="c16_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> The appetite of the laboring man laboreth for him; For his mouth urgeth him thereto. <a id="c16_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> A worthless man deviseth mischief; And in his lips there is as a scorching fire. <a id="c16_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> A perverse man scattereth abroad strife; And a whisperer separateth chief friends. <a id="c16_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> A man of violence enticeth his neighbor, And leadeth him in a way that is not good. <a id="c16_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> He that shutteth his eyes, it is to devise perverse things: He that compresseth his lips bringeth evil to pass. <a id="c16_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> The hoary head is a crown of glory; It shall be found in the way of righteousness. <a id="c16_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; And he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city. <a id="c16_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> The lot is cast into the lap; But the whole disposing thereof is of Jehovah.</p>
