<h2>Jonah 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the second time, saying, <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days’ journey. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water; <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not.</p>
