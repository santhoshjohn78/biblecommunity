<h2>Ecclesiastes 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven: <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth? <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith. <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> He hath made everything beautiful in its time: also he hath set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good so long as they live. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God hath done it, that men should fear before him. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> That which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be hath long ago been: and God seeketh again that which is passed away. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> I said in my heart, It is because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are but as beasts. <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth? <a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him back to see what shall be after him?</p>
