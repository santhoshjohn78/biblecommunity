<h2>Psalms 26</h2>

<p><a id="c26_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in Jehovah without wavering. <a id="c26_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me; Try my heart and my mind. <a id="c26_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes; And I have walked in thy truth. <a id="c26_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I have not sat with men of falsehood; Neither will I go in with dissemblers. <a id="c26_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I hate the assembly of evil-doers, And will not sit with the wicked. <a id="c26_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I will wash my hands in innocency: So will I compass thine altar, O Jehovah; <a id="c26_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, And tell of all thy wondrous works. <a id="c26_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Jehovah, I love the habitation of thy house, And the place where thy glory dwelleth. <a id="c26_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Gather not my soul with sinners, Nor my life with men of blood; <a id="c26_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> In whose hands is wickedness, And their right hand is full of bribes. <a id="c26_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: Redeem me, and be merciful unto me. <a id="c26_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> My foot standeth in an even place: In the congregations will I bless Jehovah.</p>
