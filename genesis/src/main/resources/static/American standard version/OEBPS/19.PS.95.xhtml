<h2>Psalms 95</h2>

<p><a id="c95_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Oh come, let us sing unto Jehovah; Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. <a id="c95_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; Let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. <a id="c95_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For Jehovah is a great God, And a great King above all gods. <a id="c95_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> In his hand are the deep places of the earth; The heights of the mountains are his also. <a id="c95_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The sea is his, and he made it; And his hands formed the dry land. <a id="c95_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker: <a id="c95_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For he is our God, And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day, oh that ye would hear his voice! <a id="c95_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness; <a id="c95_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> When your fathers tempted me, Proved me, and saw my work. <a id="c95_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Forty years long was I grieved with that generation, And said, It is a people that do err in their heart, And they have not known my ways: <a id="c95_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Wherefore I sware in my wrath, That they should not enter into my rest.</p>
