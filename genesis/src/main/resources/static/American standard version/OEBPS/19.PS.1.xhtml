<h2>Psalms 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers: <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; And on his law doth he meditate day and night. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also doth not wither; And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The wicked are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish.</p>
