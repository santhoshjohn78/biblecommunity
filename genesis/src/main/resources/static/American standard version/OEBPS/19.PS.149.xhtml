<h2>Psalms 149</h2>

<p><a id="c149_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise ye Jehovah. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, And his praise in the assembly of the saints. <a id="c149_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. <a id="c149_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Let them praise his name in the dance: Let them sing praises unto him with timbrel and harp. <a id="c149_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people: He will beautify the meek with salvation. <a id="c149_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Let the saints exult in glory: Let them sing for joy upon their beds. <a id="c149_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand; <a id="c149_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> To execute vengeance upon the nations, And punishments upon the peoples; <a id="c149_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron; <a id="c149_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> To execute upon them the judgment written: This honor have all his saints. Praise ye Jehovah.</p>
