<h2>Numbers 23</h2>

<p><a id="c23_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. <a id="c23_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. <a id="c23_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go: peradventure Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a bare height. <a id="c23_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. <a id="c23_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Jehovah put a word in Balaamâ€™s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. <a id="c23_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. <a id="c23_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram hath Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, And come, defy Israel. <a id="c23_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah hath not defied? <a id="c23_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him:</p>

<p><a id="c23_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his! <a id="c23_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether. <a id="c23_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Jehovah putteth in my mouth?</p>

<p><a id="c23_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence. <a id="c23_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar. <a id="c23_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I meet Jehovah yonder. <a id="c23_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak. <a id="c23_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And he came to him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath Jehovah spoken? <a id="c23_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: <a id="c23_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> God is not a man, that he should lie, Neither the son of man, that he should repent: Hath he said, and will he not do it? Or hath he spoken, and will he not make it good? <a id="c23_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Behold, I have received commandment to bless: And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it. <a id="c23_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob; Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: Jehovah his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them. <a id="c23_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> God bringeth them forth out of Egypt; He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox. <a id="c23_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel: Now shalt it be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought! <a id="c23_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness, And as a lion doth he lift himself up: He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, And drink the blood of the slain.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all. <a id="c23_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaketh, that I must do? <a id="c23_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence. <a id="c23_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert. <a id="c23_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. <a id="c23_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.</p>
