<h2>Ezekiel 25</h2>

<p><a id="c25_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, <a id="c25_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Son of man, set thy face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them: <a id="c25_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and say unto the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity: <a id="c25_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> therefore, behold, I will deliver thee to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk. <a id="c25_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching-place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. <a id="c25_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast clapped thy hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the despite of thy soul against the land of Israel; <a id="c25_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee off from the peoples, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah. <a id="c25_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the nations; <a id="c25_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim, <a id="c25_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> unto the children of the east, to go against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations. <a id="c25_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. <a id="c25_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; <a id="c25_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; even unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword. <a id="c25_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord Jehovah. <a id="c25_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity; <a id="c25_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. <a id="c25_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.</p>
