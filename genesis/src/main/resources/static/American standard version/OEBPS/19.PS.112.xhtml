<h2>Psalms 112</h2>

<p><a id="c112_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise ye Jehovah. Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah, That delighteth greatly in his commandments. <a id="c112_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> His seed shall be mighty upon earth: The generation of the upright shall be blessed. <a id="c112_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Wealth and riches are in his house; And his righteousness endureth for ever. <a id="c112_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: He is gracious, and merciful, and righteous. <a id="c112_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth; He shall maintain his cause in judgment. <a id="c112_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For he shall never be moved; The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. <a id="c112_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah. <a id="c112_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, Until he see his desire upon his adversaries. <a id="c112_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He hath dispersed, he hath given to the needy; His righteousness endureth for ever: His horn shall be exalted with honor. <a id="c112_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: The desire of the wicked shall perish.</p>
