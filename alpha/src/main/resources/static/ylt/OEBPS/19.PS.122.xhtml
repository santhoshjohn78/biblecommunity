<h2>Psalms 122</h2>

<p><a id="c122_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Song of the Ascents, by David. I have rejoiced in those saying to me, `To the house of Jehovah we go.'</p>

<p><a id="c122_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Our feet have been standing in thy gates, O Jerusalem!</p>

<p><a id="c122_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jerusalem--the builded one--[Is] as a city that is joined to itself together.</p>

<p><a id="c122_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For thither have tribes gone up, Tribes of Jah, companies of Israel, To give thanks to the name of Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c122_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For there have sat thrones of judgment, Thrones of the house of David.</p>

<p><a id="c122_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Ask ye the peace of Jerusalem, At rest are those loving thee.</p>

<p><a id="c122_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Peace is in thy bulwark, rest in thy high places,</p>

<p><a id="c122_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For the sake of my brethren and my companions, Let me speak, I pray thee, `Peace [be] in thee.'</p>

<p><a id="c122_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God, I seek good for thee!</p>
