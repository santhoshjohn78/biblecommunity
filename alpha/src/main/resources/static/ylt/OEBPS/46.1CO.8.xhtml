<h2>1 Corinthians 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And concerning the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that we all have knowledge: knowledge puffeth up, but love buildeth up;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and if any one doth think to know anything, he hath not yet known anything according as it behoveth [him] to know;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and if any one doth love God, this one hath been known by Him.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Concerning the eating then of the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that an idol [is] nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> for even if there are those called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon earth-- as there are gods many and lords many--</p>

<p><a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> yet to us [is] one God, the Father, of whom [are] the all things, and we to Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom [are] the all things, and we through Him;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> but not in all men [is] the knowledge, and certain with conscience of the idol, till now, as a thing sacrificed to an idol do eat [it], and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But victuals do not commend us to God, for neither if we may eat are we in advance; nor if we may not eat, are we behind;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> but see, lest this privilege of yours may become a stumbling-block to the infirm,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for if any one may see thee that hast knowledge in an idol's temple reclining at meat--shall not his conscience--he being infirm--be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to idols,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and the brother who is infirm shall perish by thy knowledge, because of whom Christ died?</p>

<p><a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and thus sinning in regard to the brethren, and smiting their weak conscience-- in regard to Christ ye sin;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> wherefore, if victuals cause my brother to stumble, I may eat no flesh--to the age--that my brother I may not cause to stumble.</p>
