<h2>Psalms 127</h2>

<p><a id="c127_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Song of the Ascents, by Solomon. If Jehovah doth not build the house, In vain have its builders laboured at it, If Jehovah doth not watch a city, In vain hath a watchman waked.</p>

<p><a id="c127_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Vain for you who are rising early, Who delay sitting, eating the bread of griefs, So He giveth to His beloved one sleep.</p>

<p><a id="c127_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Lo, an inheritance of Jehovah [are] sons, A reward [is] the fruit of the womb.</p>

<p><a id="c127_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> As arrows in the hand of a mighty one, So [are] the sons of the young men.</p>

<p><a id="c127_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> O the happiness of the man Who hath filled his quiver with them, They are not ashamed, For they speak with enemies in the gate!</p>
