<h2>Exodus 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `One plague more I do bring in on Pharaoh, and on Egypt, afterwards he doth send you away from this; when he is sending you away, he surely casteth you out altogether from this [place];</p>

<p><a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> speak, I pray thee, in the ears of the people, and they ask--each man from his neighbour, and each woman from her neighbour, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Jehovah giveth the grace of the people in the eyes of the Egyptians; also the man Moses [is] very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of the servants of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of the people.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Moses saith, `Thus said Jehovah, About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and every first-born in the land of Egypt hath died, from the first-born of Pharaoh who is sitting on his throne, unto the first-born of the maid-servant who [is] behind the millstones, and all the first-born of beasts;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and there hath been a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as there hath not been, and such as there is not again.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `And against all the sons of Israel a dog sharpeneth not its tongue, from man even unto beast, so that ye know that Jehovah doth make a separation between the Egyptians and Israel;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and all these thy servants have come down unto me, and bowed themselves to me, saying, Go out, thou and all the people who [are] at thy feet; and afterwards I do go out;' --and he goeth out from Pharaoh in the heat of anger.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Pharaoh doth not hearken unto you, so as to multiply My wonders in the land of Egypt;'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and Moses and Aaron have done all these wonders before Pharaoh, and Jehovah strengtheneth Pharaoh's heart, and he hath not sent the sons of Israel out of his land.</p>
