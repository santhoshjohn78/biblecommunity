<h2>2 Timothy 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Thou, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that [is] in Christ Jesus,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and the things that thou didst hear from me through many witnesses, these things be committing to stedfast men, who shall be sufficient also others to teach;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> thou, therefore, suffer evil as a good soldier of Jesus Christ;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> no one serving as a soldier did entangle himself with the affairs of life, that him who did enlist him he may please;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and if also any one may strive, he is not crowned, except he may strive lawfully;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> the labouring husbandman it behoveth first of the fruits to partake;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> be considering what things I say, for the Lord give to thee understanding in all things.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Remember Jesus Christ, raised out of the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> in which I suffer evil--unto bonds, as an evil-doer, but the word of God hath not been bound;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> because of this all things do I endure, because of the choice ones, that they also salvation may obtain that [is] in Christ Jesus, with glory age-during.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Stedfast [is] the word: For if we died together--we also shall live together;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> if we do endure together--we shall also reign together; if we deny [him], he also shall deny us;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> if we are not stedfast, he remaineth stedfast; to deny himself he is not able.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> These things remind [them] of, testifying fully before the Lord--not to strive about words to nothing profitable, but to the subversion of those hearing;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> be diligent to present thyself approved to God--a workman irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of the truth;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and the profane vain talkings stand aloof from, for to more impiety they will advance,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and their word as a gangrene will have pasture, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> who concerning the truth did swerve, saying the rising again to have already been, and do overthrow the faith of some;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> sure, nevertheless, hath the foundation of God stood, having this seal, `The Lord hath known those who are His,' and `Let him depart from unrighteousness--every one who is naming the name of Christ.'</p>

<p><a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour, and some to dishonour:</p>

<p><a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> if, then, any one may cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified and profitable to the master--to every good work having been prepared,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and the youthful lusts flee thou, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those calling upon the Lord out of a pure heart;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and the foolish and uninstructed questions be avoiding, having known that they beget strife,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and a servant of the Lord it behoveth not to strive, but to be gentle unto all, apt to teach, patient under evil,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> in meekness instructing those opposing--if perhaps God may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and they may awake out of the devil's snare, having been caught by him at his will.</p>
