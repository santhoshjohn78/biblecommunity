<h2>1 Thessalonians 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need of my writing to you,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> for yourselves have known thoroughly that the day of the Lord as a thief in the night doth so come,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> for when they may say, Peace and surety, then sudden destruction doth stand by them, as the travail [doth] her who is with child, and they shall not escape;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day may catch you as a thief;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> all ye are sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of night, nor of darkness,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> so, then, we may not sleep as also the others, but watch and be sober,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> for those sleeping, by night do sleep, and those making themselves drunk, by night are drunken,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and we, being of the day--let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and an helmet--a hope of salvation,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> because God did not appoint us to anger, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> who did die for us, that whether we wake--whether we sleep--together with him we may live;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> wherefore, comfort ye one another, and build ye up, one the one, as also ye do.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And we ask you, brethren, to know those labouring among you, and leading you in the Lord, and admonishing you,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and to esteem them very abundantly in love, because of their work; be at peace among yourselves;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, comfort the feebleminded, support the infirm, be patient unto all;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> see no one evil for evil may render to any one, but always that which is good pursue ye, both to one another and to all;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> always rejoice ye;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> continually pray ye;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> in every thing give thanks, for this [is] the will of God in Christ Jesus in regard to you.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The Spirit quench not;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> prophesyings despise not;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> all things prove; that which is good hold fast;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> from all appearance of evil abstain ye;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and the God of the peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved unblameably in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> stedfast is He who is calling you, who also will do [it].</p>

<p><a id="c5_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Brethren, pray for us;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> salute all the brethren in an holy kiss;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> I charge you [by] the Lord, that the letter be read to all the holy brethren;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with you! Amen.</p>
