<h2>Luke 24</h2>

<p><a id="c24_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And on the first of the sabbaths, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bearing the spices they made ready, and certain [others] with them,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and having gone in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And it came to pass, while they are perplexed about this, that lo, two men stood by them in glittering apparel,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and on their having become afraid, and having inclined the face to the earth, they said to them, `Why do ye seek the living with the dead?</p>

<p><a id="c24_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> he is not here, but was raised; remember how he spake to you, being yet in Galilee,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> saying--It behoveth the Son of Man to be delivered up to the hands of sinful men, and to be crucified, and the third day to rise again.'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And they remembered his sayings,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and having turned back from the tomb told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And it was the Magdalene Mary, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the other women with them, who told unto the apostles these things,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and their sayings appeared before them as idle talk, and they were not believing them.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Peter having risen, did run to the tomb, and having stooped down he seeth the linen clothes lying alone, and he went away to his own home, wondering at that which was come to pass.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And, lo, two of them were going on during that day to a village, distant sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, the name of which [is] Emmaus,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and they were conversing with one another about all these things that have happened.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And it came to pass in their conversing and reasoning together, that Jesus himself, having come nigh, was going on with them,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and their eyes were holden so as not to know him,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and he said unto them, `What [are] these words that ye exchange with one another, walking, and ye are sad?'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the one, whose name was Cleopas, answering, said unto him, `Art thou alone such a stranger in Jerusalem, that thou hast not known the things that came to pass in it in these days?'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And he said to them, `What things?' And they said to him, `The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who became a man--a prophet--powerful in deed and word, before God and all the people,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> how also the chief priests and our rulers did deliver him up to a judgment of death, and crucified him;</p>

<p><a id="c24_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and we were hoping that he it is who is about to redeem Israel, and also with all these things, this third day is passing to-day, since these things happened.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> `And certain women of ours also astonished us, coming early to the tomb,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and not having found his body, they came, saying also to have seen an apparition of messengers, who say he is alive,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and certain of those with us went away unto the tomb, and found as even the women said, and him they saw not.'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And he said unto them, `O inconsiderate and slow in heart, to believe on all that the prophets spake!</p>

<p><a id="c24_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Was it not behoving the Christ these things to suffer, and to enter into his glory?'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and having begun from Moses, and from all the prophets, he was expounding to them in all the Writings the things about himself.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And they came nigh to the village whither they were going, and he made an appearance of going on further,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and they constrained him, saying, `Remain with us, for it is toward evening,' and the day did decline, and he went in to remain with them.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And it came to pass, in his reclining (at meat) with them, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken, he was giving to them,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he became unseen by them.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And they said one to another, `Was not our heart burning within us, as he was speaking to us in the way, and as he was opening up to us the Writings?'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And they, having risen up the same hour, turned back to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven, and those with them,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> saying--`The Lord was raised indeed, and was seen by Simon;'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> and they were telling the things in the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> and as they are speaking these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith to them, `Peace--to you;'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> and being amazed, and becoming affrighted, they were thinking themselves to see a spirit.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And he said to them, `Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do reasonings come up in your hearts?</p>

<p><a id="c24_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> see my hands and my feet, that I am he; handle me and see, because a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me having.'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And having said this, he shewed to them the hands and the feet,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> and while they are not believing from the joy, and wondering, he said to them, `Have ye anything here to eat?'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> and they gave to him part of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> and having taken, he did eat before them,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> and he said to them, `These [are] the words that I spake unto you, being yet with you, that it behoveth to be fulfilled all the things that are written in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, about me.'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> Then opened he up their understanding to understand the Writings,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> and he said to them--`Thus it hath been written, and thus it was behoving the Christ to suffer, and to rise out of the dead the third day,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> and reformation and remission of sins to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem:</p>

<p><a id="c24_v48"></a><span class="vn">48</span> and ye--ye are witnesses of these things.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v49"></a><span class="vn">49</span> `And, lo, I do send the promise of my Father upon you, but ye--abide ye in the city of Jerusalem till ye be clothed with power from on high.'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v50"></a><span class="vn">50</span> And he led them forth without--unto Bethany, and having lifted up his hands he did bless them,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v51"></a><span class="vn">51</span> and it came to pass, in his blessing them, he was parted from them, and was borne up to the heaven;</p>

<p><a id="c24_v52"></a><span class="vn">52</span> and they, having bowed before him, did turn back to Jerusalem with great joy,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v53"></a><span class="vn">53</span> and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</p>
