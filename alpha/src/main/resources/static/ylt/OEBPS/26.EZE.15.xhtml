<h2>Ezekiel 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Son of man, What is the vine-tree more than any tree? The vine-branch that hath been, Among trees of the forest?</p>

<p><a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Is wood taken from it to use for work? Do they take of it a pin to hang any vessel on it?</p>

<p><a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Lo, to the fire it hath been given for fuel, Its two ends hath the fire eaten, And its midst hath been scorched! Is it profitable for work?</p>

<p><a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Lo, in its being perfect it is not used for work, How much less, when fire hath eaten of it, And it is scorched, Hath it been used yet for work?</p>

<p><a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree among trees of the forest, That I have given to the fire for fuel, So I have given the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I have set My face against them, From the fire they have gone forth, And the fire doth consume them, And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah, In My setting My face against them.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I have made the land a desolation, Because they have committed a trespass, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah!'</p>
