<h2>Psalms 61</h2>

<p><a id="c61_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To the Overseer, on stringed instruments. --By David. Hear, O God, my loud cry, attend to my prayer.</p>

<p><a id="c61_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> From the end of the land unto Thee I call, In the feebleness of my heart, Into a rock higher than I Thou dost lead me.</p>

<p><a id="c61_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For Thou hast been a refuge for me, A tower of strength because of the enemy.</p>

<p><a id="c61_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I sojourn in Thy tent to the ages, I trust in the secret place of Thy wings. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c61_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For Thou, O God, hast hearkened to my vows, Thou hast appointed the inheritance Of those fearing Thy name.</p>

<p><a id="c61_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Days to the days of the king Thou addest, His years as generation and generation.</p>

<p><a id="c61_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He dwelleth to the age before God, Kindness and truth appoint--they keep him.</p>

<p><a id="c61_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> So do I praise Thy name for ever, When I pay my vows day by day!</p>
