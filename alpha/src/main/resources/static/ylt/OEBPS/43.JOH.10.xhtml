<h2>John 10</h2>

<p><a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> `Verily, verily, I say to you, He who is not entering through the door to the fold of the sheep, but is going up from another side, that one is a thief and a robber;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and he who is entering through the door is shepherd of the sheep;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> to this one the doorkeeper doth open, and the sheep hear his voice, and his own sheep he doth call by name, and doth lead them forth;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and when his own sheep he may put forth, before them he goeth on, and the sheep follow him, because they have known his voice;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him, because they have not known the voice of strangers.'</p>

<p><a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> This similitude spake Jesus to them, and they knew not what the things were that he was speaking to them;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Jesus said therefore again to them, `Verily, verily, I say to you--I am the door of the sheep;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> all, as many as came before me, are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I am the door, through me if any one may come in, he shall be saved, and he shall come in, and go out, and find pasture.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> `The thief doth not come, except that he may steal, and kill, and destroy; I came that they may have life, and may have [it] abundantly.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> `I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd his life layeth down for the sheep;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and the hireling, and not being a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, doth behold the wolf coming, and doth leave the sheep, and doth flee; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and the hireling doth flee because he is an hireling, and is not caring for the sheep.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> `I am the good shepherd, and I know my [sheep], and am known by mine,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> according as the Father doth know me, and I know the Father, and my life I lay down for the sheep,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and other sheep I have that are not of this fold, these also it behoveth me to bring, and my voice they will hear, and there shall become one flock--one shepherd.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> `Because of this doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that again I may take it;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> no one doth take it from me, but I lay it down of myself; authority I have to lay it down, and authority I have again to take it; this command I received from my Father.'</p>

<p><a id="c10_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Therefore, again, there came a division among the Jews, because of these words,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and many of them said, `He hath a demon, and is mad, why do ye hear him?'</p>

<p><a id="c10_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> others said, `These sayings are not those of a demoniac; is a demon able blind men's eyes to open?'</p>

<p><a id="c10_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And the dedication in Jerusalem came, and it was winter,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the porch of Solomon,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> the Jews, therefore, came round about him, and said to him, `Till when our soul dost thou hold in suspense? if thou art the Christ, tell us freely.'</p>

<p><a id="c10_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Jesus answered them, `I told you, and ye do not believe; the works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify concerning me;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> according as I said to you: My sheep my voice do hear, and I know them, and they follow me,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and life age-during I give to them, and they shall not perish--to the age, and no one shall pluck them out of my hand;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> my Father, who hath given to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to pluck out of the hand of my Father;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> I and the Father are one.'</p>

<p><a id="c10_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Therefore, again, did the Jews take up stones that they may stone him;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> Jesus answered them, `Many good works did I shew you from my Father; because of which work of them do ye stone me?'</p>

<p><a id="c10_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> The Jews answered him, saying, `For a good work we do not stone thee, but for evil speaking, and because thou, being a man, dost make thyself God.'</p>

<p><a id="c10_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Jesus answered them, `Is it not having been written in your law: I said, ye are gods?</p>

<p><a id="c10_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> if them he did call gods unto whom the word of God came, (and the Writing is not able to be broken,)</p>

<p><a id="c10_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> of him whom the Father did sanctify, and send to the world, do ye say--Thou speakest evil, because I said, Son of God I am?</p>

<p><a id="c10_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> if I do not the works of my Father, do not believe me;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and if I do, even if me ye may not believe, the works believe, that ye may know and may believe that in me [is] the Father, and I in Him.'</p>

<p><a id="c10_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> Therefore were they seeking again to seize him, and he went forth out of their hand,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> and went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John was at first baptizing, and remained there,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> and many came unto him, and said--`John, indeed, did no sign, and all things, as many as John said about this one were true;'</p>

<p><a id="c10_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> and many did believe in him there.</p>
