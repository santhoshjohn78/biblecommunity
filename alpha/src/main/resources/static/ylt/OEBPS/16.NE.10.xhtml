<p><a id="c10_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And we have appointed for ourselves commands, to put on ourselves the third of a shekel in a year, for the service of the house of our God,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> for bread of the arrangement, and the continual present, and the continual burntoffering of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for appointed seasons, and for holy things, and for sinofferings, to make atonement for Israel, even all the workof the house of our God.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And the beginning of our dough, and our heave-offerings, and the fruit of every tree, of new wine, and of oil, we bring in to the priests, unto the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithe of our ground to the Levites; and they--theLevites--have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and the priest, son of Aaron, hath been with the Levites in the tithing of the Levites, and the Levites bring up the tithe of the tithe to the house of our God unto the chambers, to the treasure-house;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> for unto the chambers do they bring in--the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi-- the heave-offering of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, and there [are] vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests, those ministering, and the gatekeepers, and the singers, and we do not forsake the house of our God.</p>
