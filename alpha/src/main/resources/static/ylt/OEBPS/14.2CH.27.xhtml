<h2>2 Chronicles 27</h2>

<p><a id="c27_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A son of twenty and five years [is] Jotham in his reigning, and sixteen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother [is] Jerushah daughter of Zadok.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that Uzziah his father did; only, he hath not come in unto the temple of Jehovah; and again are the people doing corruptly.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He hath built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, and in the wall of Ophel he hath built abundantly;</p>

<p><a id="c27_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and cities he hath built in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he hath built palaces and towers.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And he hath fought with the king of the sons of Ammon, and prevaileth over them, and the sons of Ammon give to him in that year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cors of wheat, and of barley ten thousand; this have the sons of Ammon returned to him both in the second year, and in the third.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Jotham doth strengthen himself, for he hath prepared his ways before Jehovah his God.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the rest of the matters of Jotham, and all his battles, and his ways, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> A son of twenty and five years was he in his reigning, and sixteen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem;</p>

<p><a id="c27_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and Jotham lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David, and reign doth Ahaz his son in his stead.</p>
