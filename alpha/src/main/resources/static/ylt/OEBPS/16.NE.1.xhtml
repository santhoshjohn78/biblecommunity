<h2>Nehemiah 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Words of Nehemiah son of Hachaliah. And it cometh to pass, in the month of Chisleu, the twentieth year, and I have been in Shushan the palace,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and come in doth Hanani, one of my brethren, he and men of Judah, and I ask them concerning the Jews, the escaped part that have been left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and they say to me, `Those left, who have been left of the captivity there in the province, [are] in great evil, and in reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burnt with fire.'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And it cometh to pass, at my hearing these words, I have sat down, and I weep and mourn [for] days, and I am fasting and praying before the God of the heavens.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And I say, `I beseech thee, O Jehovah, God of the heavens, God, the great and the fearful, keeping the covenant and kindness for those loving Him, and for those keeping His commands,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> let Thine ear be, I pray Thee, attentive, and Thine eyes open, to hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, that I am praying before Thee to-day, by day and by night, concerning the sons of Israel Thy servants, and confessing concerning the sins of the sons of Israel, that we have sinned against Thee; yea, I and the house of my father have sinned;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> we have acted very corruptly against Thee, and have not kept the commands, and the statutes, and the judgments, that Thou didst command Moses Thy servant.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> `Remember, I pray Thee, the word that Thou didst command Moses Thy servant, saying, Ye--ye trespass--I scatter you among peoples;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and ye have turned back unto Me, and kept My commands, and done them--if your outcast is in the end of the heavens, thence I gather them, and have brought them in unto the place that I have chosen to cause My name to tabernacle there.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And they [are] Thy servants, and Thy people, whom Thou hast ransomed by Thy great power, and by Thy strong hand.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> `I beseech Thee, O Lord, let, I pray Thee, Thine ear be attentive unto the prayer of Thy servant, and unto the prayer of Thy servants, those delighting to fear Thy Name; and give prosperity, I pray Thee, to Thy servant to-day, and give him for mercies before this man;' and I have been butler to the king.</p>
