<h2>2 Corinthians 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I decided this to myself, not again to come in sorrow unto you,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> for if I make you sorry, then who is he who is making me glad, except he who is made sorry by me?</p>

<p><a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and I wrote to you this same thing, that having come, I may not have sorrow from them of whom it behoved me to have joy, having confidence in you all, that my joy is of you all,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> for out of much tribulation and pressure of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that ye might be made sorry, but that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly toward you.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And if any one hath caused sorrow, he hath not caused sorrow to me, but in part, that I may not burden you all;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> sufficient to such a one is this punishment, that [is] by the more part,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> so that, on the contrary, [it is] rather for you to forgive and to comfort, lest by over abundant sorrow such a one may be swallowed up;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> wherefore, I call upon you to confirm love to him,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for, for this also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether in regard to all things ye are obedient.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And to whom ye forgive anything--I also; for I also, if I have forgiven anything, to whom I have forgiven [it], because of you--in the person of Christ--[I forgive it,]</p>

<p><a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> that we may not be over-reached by the Adversary, for of his devices we are not ignorant.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And having come to Troas for the good news of the Christ, and a door to me having been opened in the Lord,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I have not had rest to my spirit, on my not finding Titus my brother, but having taken leave of them, I went forth to Macedonia;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and to God [are] thanks, who at all times is leading us in triumph in the Christ, and the fragrance of His knowledge He is manifesting through us in every place,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> because of Christ a sweet fragrance we are to God, in those being saved, and in those being lost;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> to the one, indeed, a fragrance of death to death, and to the other, a fragrance of life to life; and for these things who is sufficient?</p>

<p><a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> for we are not as the many, adulterating the word of God, but as of sincerity-- but as of God; in the presence of God, in Christ we do speak.</p>
