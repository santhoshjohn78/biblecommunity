<h2>1 Corinthians 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Whoredom is actually heard of among you, and such whoredom as is not even named among the nations--as that one hath the wife of the father! --</p>

<p><a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and ye are having been puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he may be removed out of the midst of you who did this work,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> for I indeed, as being absent as to the body, and present as to the spirit, have already judged, as being present, him who so wrought this thing:</p>

<p><a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ--ye being gathered together, also my spirit- -with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> to deliver up such a one to the Adversary for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Not good [is] your glorying; have ye not known that a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven?</p>

<p><a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> cleanse out, therefore, the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened, for also our passover for us was sacrificed--Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> so that we may keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of evil and wickedness, but with unleavened food of sincerity and truth.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I did write to you in the epistle, not to keep company with whoremongers--</p>

<p><a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and not certainly with the whoremongers of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, seeing ye ought then to go forth out of the world--</p>

<p><a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and now, I did write to you not to keep company with [him], if any one, being named a brother, may be a whoremonger, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner--with such a one not even to eat together;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> for what have I also those without to judge? those within do ye not judge?</p>

<p><a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and those without God doth judge; and put ye away the evil from among yourselves.</p>
