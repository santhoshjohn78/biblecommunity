<h2>Zechariah 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the messenger who is speaking with me doth turn back, and stir me up as one who is stirred up out of his sleep,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and he saith unto me, `What art thou seeing?' And I say, `I have looked, and lo, a candlestick of gold--all of it, and its bowl [is] on its top, and its seven lamps [are] upon it, and twice seven pipes [are] to the lights that [are] on its top,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and two olive-trees [are] by it, one on the right of the bowl, and one on its left.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And I answer and speak unto the messenger who is speaking with me, saying, `What [are] these, my lord?'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the messenger who is speaking with me answereth and saith unto me, `Hast thou not known what these [are]?' And I say, `No, my lord.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he answereth and speaketh unto me, saying: `This [is] a word of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel, saying: Not by a force, nor by power, But--by My Spirit, said Jehovah of Hosts.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Who [art] thou, O great mountain Before Zerubbabel--for a plain! And he hath brought forth the top-stone, Cries of Grace, grace--[are] to it.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And there is a word of Jehovah to me, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Hands of Zerubbabel did found this house, And his hands do finish it, And thou hast known that Jehovah of Hosts Hath sent me unto you.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For who trampled on the day of small things, They have rejoiced, And seen the tin weight in the hand of Zerubbabel, These seven [are] the eyes of Jehovah, They are going to and fro in all the land.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And I answer and say unto him, `What [are] these two olive-trees, on the right of the candlestick, and on its left?'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I answer a second time, and say unto him, `What [are] the two branches of the olive trees that, by means of the two golden pipes, are emptying out of themselves the oil?'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he speaketh unto me, saying, `Hast thou not known what these [are]?' And I say, `No, my lord.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And he saith, `These [are] the two sons of the oil, who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.'</p>
