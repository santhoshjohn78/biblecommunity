<h2>1 Samuel 28</h2>

<p><a id="c28_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it cometh to pass in those days, that the Philistines gather their camps for the war, to fight against Israel, and Achish saith unto David, `Thou dost certainly know that with me thou dost go out into the camp, thou and thy men.'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And David saith unto Achish, `Therefore--thou dost know that which thy servant dost do.' And Achish saith unto David, `Therefore--keeper of my head I do appoint thee all the days.'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Samuel hath died, and all Israel mourn for him, and bury him in Ramah, even in his city, and Saul hath turned aside those having familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the Philistines are gathered, and come in, and encamp in Shunem, and Saul gathereth all Israel, and they encamp in Gilboa,</p>

<p><a id="c28_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and Saul seeth the camp of the Philistines, and feareth, and his heart trembleth greatly,</p>

<p><a id="c28_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and Saul asketh at Jehovah, and Jehovah hath not answered him, either by dreams, or by Urim, or by prophets.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Saul saith to his servants, `Seek for me a woman possessing a familiar spirit, and I go unto her, and inquire of her;' and his servants say unto him, `Lo, a woman possessing a familiar spirit in En-dor.'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Saul disguiseth himself and putteth on other garments, and goeth, he and two of the men with him, and they come in unto the woman by night, and he saith, `Divine, I pray thee, to me by the familiar spirit, and cause to come up to me himwhom I say unto thee.'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the woman saith unto him, `Lo, thou hast known that which Saul hath done, that he hath cut off those having familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land; and why art thou laying a snare for my soul--to put me to death?'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Saul sweareth to her by Jehovah, saying, `Jehovah liveth, punishment doth not meet thee for this thing.'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the woman saith, `Whom do I bring up to thee?' and he saith, `Samuel--bring up to me.'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the woman seeth Samuel, and crieth with a loud voice, and the woman speaketh unto Saul, saying, `Why hast thou deceived me--and thou Saul?'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the king saith to her, `Do not fear; for what hast thou seen?' and the woman saith unto Saul, `Gods I have seen coming up out of the earth.'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And he saith to her, `What [is] his form?' and she saith, `An aged man is coming up, and he [is] covered with an upper robe;' and Saul knoweth that he [is] Samuel, and boweth-- face to thee earth--and doth obeisance.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Samuel saith unto Saul, `Why hast thou troubled me, to bring me up?' And Saul saith, `I have great distress, and the Philistines are fighting against me, God hath turned aside from me, and hath not answered me any more, either by the hand of the prophets, or by dreams; and I call for thee to let me know what I do.'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Samuel saith, `And why dost thou ask me, and Jehovah hath turned aside from thee, and is thine enemy?</p>

<p><a id="c28_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Jehovah doth for Himself as He hath spoken by my hand, and Jehovah rendeth the kingdom out of thy hand, and giveth it to thy neighbour--to David.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, nor didst the fierceness of His anger on Amalek--therefore this thing hath Jehovah done to thee this day;</p>

<p><a id="c28_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> yea, Jehovah giveth also Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow thou and thy sons [are] with me; also the camp of Israel doth Jehovah give into the hand of the Philistines.'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Saul hasteth and falleth--the fulness of his stature--to the earth, and feareth greatly because of the words of Samuel; also power was not in him, for he had not eaten bread all the day, and all the night.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the woman cometh in unto Saul, and seeth that he hath been greatly troubled, and saith unto him, `Lo, thy maid-servant hath hearkened to thy voice, and I put my soul in my hand, and I obey thy words which thou hast spoken unto me;</p>

<p><a id="c28_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and now, hearken, I pray thee, also thou, to the voice of thy maid-servant, and I set before thee a morsel of bread, and eat, and there is in thee power when thou goest in the way.'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And he refuseth, and saith, `I do not eat;' and his servants urge on him, and also the woman, and he hearkeneth to their voice, and riseth from the earth, and sitteth on the bed.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And the woman hath a calf of the stall in the house, and she hasteth and slaughtereth it, and taketh flour, and kneadeth, and baketh it unleavened things,</p>

<p><a id="c28_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and bringeth nigh before Saul, and before his servants, and they eat, and rise, and go on, during that night.</p>
