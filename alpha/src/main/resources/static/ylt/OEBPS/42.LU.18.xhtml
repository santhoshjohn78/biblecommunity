<h2>Luke 18</h2>

<p><a id="c18_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And he spake also a simile to them, that it behoveth [us] always to pray, and not to faint,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> saying, `A certain judge was in a certain city--God he is not fearing, and man he is not regarding--</p>

<p><a id="c18_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and a widow was in that city, and she was coming unto him, saying, Do me justice on my opponent,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and he would not for a time, but after these things he said in himself, Even if God I do not fear, and man do not regard,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> yet because this widow doth give me trouble, I will do her justice, lest, perpetually coming, she may plague me.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the Lord said, `Hear ye what the unrighteous judge saith:</p>

<p><a id="c18_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and shall not God execute the justice to His choice ones, who are crying unto Him day and night--bearing long in regard to them?</p>

<p><a id="c18_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I say to you, that He will execute the justice to them quickly; but the Son of Man having come, shall he find the faith upon the earth?'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he spake also unto certain who have been trusting in themselves that they were righteous, and have been despising the rest, this simile:</p>

<p><a id="c18_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> `Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a taxgatherer;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> the Pharisee having stood by himself, thus prayed: God, I thank Thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all things--as many as I possess.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> `And the tax-gatherer, having stood afar off, would not even the eyes lift up to the heaven, but was smiting on his breast, saying, God be propitious to me--the sinner!</p>

<p><a id="c18_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I say to you, this one went down declared righteous, to his house, rather than that one: for every one who is exalting himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And they were bringing near also the babes, that he may touch them, and the disciples having seen did rebuke them,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and Jesus having called them near, said, `Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the reign of God;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> verily I say to you, Whoever may not receive the reign of God as a little child, may not enter into it.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And a certain ruler questioned him, saying, `Good teacher, what having done--shall I inherit life age-during?'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And Jesus said to him, `Why me dost thou call good? no one [is] good, except One-- God;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> the commands thou hast known: Thou mayest not commit adultery, Thou mayest do no murder, Thou mayest not steal, Thou mayest not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And he said, `All these I did keep from my youth;'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and having heard these things, Jesus said to him, `Yet one thing to thee is lacking; all things--as many as thou hast--sell, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, be following me;'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and he, having heard these things, became very sorrowful, for he was exceeding rich.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Jesus having seen him become very sorrowful, said, `How hardly shall those having riches enter into the reign of God!</p>

<p><a id="c18_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> for it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle to enter, than for a rich man into the reign of God to enter.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And those who heard, said, `And who is able to be saved?'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and he said, `The things impossible with men are possible with God.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And Peter said, `Lo, we left all, and did follow thee;'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and he said to them, `Verily I say to you, that there is not one who left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the reign of God,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> who may not receive back manifold more in this time, and in the coming age, life ageduring.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And having taken the twelve aside, he said unto them, `Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be completed--that have been written through the prophets--to the Son of Man,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> for he shall be delivered up to the nations, and shall be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> and having scourged they shall put him to death, and on the third day he shall rise again.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And they none of these things understood, and this saying was hid from them, and they were not knowing the things said.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And it came to pass, in his coming nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting beside the way begging,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> and having heard a multitude going by, he was inquiring what this may be,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> and they brought him word that Jesus the Nazarene doth pass by,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and he cried out, saying, `Jesus, Son of David, deal kindly with me;'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> and those going before were rebuking him, that he might be silent, but he was much more crying out, `Son of David, deal kindly with me.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And Jesus having stood, commanded him to be brought unto him, and he having come nigh, he questioned him,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> saying, `What wilt thou I shall do to thee?' and he said, `Sir, that I may receive sight.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> And Jesus said to him, `Receive thy sight; thy faith hath saved thee;'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> and presently he did receive sight, and was following him, glorifying God; and all the people, having seen, did give praise to God.</p>
