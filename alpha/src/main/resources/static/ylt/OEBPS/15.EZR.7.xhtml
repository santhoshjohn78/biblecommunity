<h2>Ezra 7</h2>

<p><a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the head priest;</p>

<p><a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Ezra himself hath come up from Babylon, and he [is] a scribe ready in the law of Moses, that Jehovah God of Israel gave, and the king giveth to him--according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him--all his request.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And there go up of the sons of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he cometh in to Jerusalem in the fifth month, that [is in] the seventh year of the king,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for on the first of the month he hath founded the ascent from Babylon, and on the first of the fifth month he hath come in unto Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for Ezra hath prepared his heart to seek the law of Jehovah, and to do, and to teach in Israel statute and judgment.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And this [is] a copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a scribe of the words of the commands of Jehovah, and of His statutes on Israel:</p>

<p><a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> `Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, a perfect scribe of the law of the God of heaven, and at such a time:</p>

<p><a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> By me hath been made a decree that every one who is willing, in my kingdom, of the people of Israel and of its priests and Levites, to go to Jerusalem with thee, doth go;</p>

<p><a id="c7_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> because that from the king and his seven counsellors thou art sent, to inquire concerning Judah and concerning Jerusalem, with the law of God that [is] in thy hand,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and to carry silver and gold that the king and his counsellors willingly offered to the God of Israel, whose tabernacle [is] in Jerusalem,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and all the silver and gold that thou findest in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offerings of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly, for the house of their God that [is] in Jerusalem,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> therefore thou dost speedily buy with this money, bullocks, rams, lambs, and their presents, and their libations, and dost bring them near to the altar of the house of your God that [is] in Jerusalem,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and that which to thee and to thy brethren is good to do with the rest of the silver and gold, according to the will of your God ye do.'</p>

<p><a id="c7_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> `And the vessels that are given to thee, for the service of the house of thy God, make perfect before the God of Jerusalem;</p>

<p><a id="c7_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and the rest of the needful things of the house of thy God, that it falleth to thee to give, thou dost give from the treasure-house of the king.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> `And by me--I Artaxerxes the king--is made a decree to all treasurers who [are] beyond the river, that all that Ezra the priest, scribe of the law of the God of heaven, doth ask of you, be done speedily:</p>

<p><a id="c7_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Unto silver a hundred talents, and unto wheat a hundred cors, and unto wine a hundred baths, and unto oil a hundred baths, and salt without reckoning;</p>

<p><a id="c7_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> all that [is] by the decree of the God of heaven, let be done diligently for the house of the God of heaven; for why is there wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons?</p>

<p><a id="c7_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> `And to you we are making known, that upon any of the priests and Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, and servants of the house of God, tribute and custom there is no authority to lift up.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> `And thou, Ezra, according to the wisdom of thy God, that [is] in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges who may be judges to all the people who are beyond the river, to all knowing the law of thy God, and he who hath not known ye cause to know;</p>

<p><a id="c7_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and any who doth not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, speedily is judgment done upon him, whether to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of riches, and to bonds.'</p>

<p><a id="c7_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Blessed [is] Jehovah, God of our fathers, who hath given such a thing as this in the heart of the king, to beautify the house of Jehovah that [is] in Jerusalem,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and unto me hath stretched out kindness before the king and his counsellors, and before all the mighty heads of the king: and I have strengthened myself as the hand of Jehovah my God [is] upon me, and I gather out of Israel heads to go up with me.</p>
