<h2>Isaiah 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And thou hast said in that day: `I thank thee, O Jehovah, Though Thou hast been angry with me, Turn back doth Thine anger, And Thou dost comfort me.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Lo, God [is] my salvation, I trust, and fear not, For my strength and song [is] Jah Jehovah, And He is to me for salvation.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And ye have drawn waters with joy Out of the fountains of salvation,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And ye have said in that day, Give ye praise to Jehovah, call in His name. Make known among the peoples His acts. Make mention that set on high is His name.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Praise ye Jehovah, for excellence He hath done, Known is this in all the earth.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Cry aloud, and sing, O inhabitant of Zion, For great in thy midst [is] the Holy One of Israel!'</p>
