<h2>Genesis 33</h2>

<p><a id="c33_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jacob lifteth up his eyes, and looketh, and lo, Esau is coming, and with him four hundred men; and he divideth the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two maidservants;</p>

<p><a id="c33_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and he setteth the maid-servants and their children first, and Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he himself passed over before them, and boweth himself to the earth seven times, until his drawing nigh unto his brother,</p>

<p><a id="c33_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and Esau runneth to meet him, and embraceth him, and falleth on his neck, and kisseth him, and they weep;</p>

<p><a id="c33_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and he lifteth up his eyes, and seeth the women and the children, and saith, `What [are] these to thee?' And he saith, `The children with whom God hath favoured thy servant.'</p>

<p><a id="c33_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the maid-servants draw nigh, they and their children, and bow themselves;</p>

<p><a id="c33_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and Leah also draweth nigh, and her children, and they bow themselves; and afterwards Joseph hath drawn nigh with Rachel, and they bow themselves.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he saith, `What to thee [is] all this camp which I have met?' and he saith, `To find grace in the eyes of my lord.'</p>

<p><a id="c33_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Esau saith, `I have abundance, my brother, let it be to thyself that which thou hast.'</p>

<p><a id="c33_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Jacob saith, `Nay, I pray thee, if, I pray thee, I have found grace in thine eyes, then thou hast received my present from my hand, because that I have seen thy face, as the seeing of the face of God, and thou art pleased with me;</p>

<p><a id="c33_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> receive, I pray thee, my blessing, which is brought to thee, because God hath favoured me, and because I have all [things];' and he presseth on him, and he receiveth,</p>

<p><a id="c33_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and saith, `Let us journey and go on, and I go on before thee.'</p>

<p><a id="c33_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he saith unto him, `My lord knoweth that the children [are] tender, and the suckling flock and the herd [are] with me; when they have beaten them one day, then hath all the flock died.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant, and I--I lead on gently, according to the foot of the work which [is] before me, and to the foot of the children, until that I come unto my lord, to Seir.'</p>

<p><a id="c33_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Esau saith, `Let me, I pray thee, place with thee some of the people who [are] with me;' and he said, `Why [is] this? I find grace in the eyes of my lord.'</p>

<p><a id="c33_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And turn back on that day doth Esau on his way to Seir;</p>

<p><a id="c33_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and Jacob hath journeyed to Succoth, and buildeth to himself a house, and for his cattle hath made booths, therefore hath he called the name of the place Succoth.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Jacob cometh in to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which [is] in the land of Canaan, in his coming from Padan-Aram, and encampeth before the city,</p>

<p><a id="c33_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and he buyeth the portion of the field where he hath stretched out his tent, from the hand of the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred kesitah;</p>

<p><a id="c33_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and he setteth up there an altar, and proclaimeth at it God--the God of Israel.</p>
