<h2>Ephesians 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Become, then, followers of God, as children beloved,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and walk in love, as also the Christ did love us, and did give himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odour of a sweet smell,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and whoredom, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> also filthiness, and foolish talking, or jesting, --the things not fit--but rather thanksgiving;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> for this ye know, that every whoremonger, or unclean, or covetous person, who is an idolater, hath no inheritance in the reign of the Christ and God.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> become not, then, partakers with them,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> for ye were once darkness, and now light in the Lord; as children of light walk ye,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for the fruit of the Spirit [is] in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of the darkness and rather even convict,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> for the things in secret done by them it is a shame even to speak of,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and all the things reproved by the light are manifested, for everything that is manifested is light;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> wherefore he saith, `Arouse thyself, thou who art sleeping, and arise out of the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee.'</p>

<p><a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> See, then, how exactly ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> redeeming the time, because the days are evil;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> because of this become not fools, but--understanding what [is] the will of the Lord,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and be not drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in the Spirit,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the God and Father;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of God.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> The wives! to your own husbands subject yourselves, as to the Lord,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> because the husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ [is] head of the assembly, and he is saviour of the body,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> but even as the assembly is subject to Christ, so also [are] the wives to their own husbands in everything.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The husbands! love your own wives, as also the Christ did love the assembly, and did give himself for it,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> that he might sanctify it, having cleansed [it] with the bathing of the water in the saying,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> that he might present it to himself the assembly in glory, not having spot or wrinkle, or any of such things, but that it may be holy and unblemished;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> so ought the husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies: he who is loving his own wife--himself he doth love;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> for no one ever his own flesh did hate, but doth nourish and cherish it, as also the Lord--the assembly,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> because members we are of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> `for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they shall be--the two--for one flesh;'</p>

<p><a id="c5_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> this secret is great, and I speak in regard to Christ and to the assembly;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> but ye also, every one in particular--let each his own wife so love as himself, and the wife--that she may reverence the husband.</p>
