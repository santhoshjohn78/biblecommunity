<h2>Leviticus 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> `And if his offering [is] a sacrifice of peace-offerings, if out of the herd he is bringing near, whether male or female, a perfect one he doth bring near before Jehovah,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and he hath laid his hand on the head of his offering, and hath slaughtered it at the opening of the tent of meeting, and sons of Aaron, the priests, have sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.</p>
