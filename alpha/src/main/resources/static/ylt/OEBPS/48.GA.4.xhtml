<h2>Galatians 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I say, so long time as the heir is a babe, he differeth nothing from a servant-- being lord of all,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> but is under tutors and stewards till the time appointed of the father,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> so also we, when we were babes, under the elements of the world were in servitude,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and when the fulness of time did come, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> that those under law he may redeem, that the adoption of sons we may receive;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and because ye are sons, God did send forth the spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, `Abba, Father!'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> so that thou art no more a servant, but a son, and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But then, indeed, not having known God, ye were in servitude to those not by nature gods,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and now, having known God--and rather being known by God--how turn ye again unto the weak and poor elements to which anew ye desire to be in servitude?</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> days ye observe, and months, and times, and years!</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> I am afraid of you, lest in vain I did labour toward you.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Become as I [am] --because I also [am] as ye brethren, I beseech you; to me ye did no hurt,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and ye have known that through infirmity of the flesh I did proclaim good news to you at the first,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and my trial that [is] in my flesh ye did not despise nor reject, but as a messenger of God ye did receive me--as Christ Jesus;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> what then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that if possible, your eyes having plucked out, ye would have given to me;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> so that your enemy have I become, being true to you?</p>

<p><a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> they are zealous for you--[yet] not well, but they wish to shut us out, that for them ye may be zealous;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and [it is] good to be zealously regarded, in what is good, at all times, and not only in my being present with you;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> my little children, of whom again I travail in birth, till Christ may be formed in you,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and I was wishing to be present with you now, and to change my voice, because I am in doubt about you.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Tell me, ye who are willing to be under law, the law do ye not hear?</p>

<p><a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> for it hath been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the maid-servant, and one by the free-woman,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> but he who [is] of the maid-servant, according to flesh hath been, and he who [is] of the free-woman, through the promise;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> which things are allegorized, for these are the two covenants: one, indeed, from mount Sinai, to servitude bringing forth, which is Hagar;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> for this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and doth correspond to the Jerusalem that now [is], and is in servitude with her children,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and the Jerusalem above is the free-woman, which is mother of us all,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> for it hath been written, `Rejoice, O barren, who art not bearing; break forth and cry, thou who art not travailing, because many [are] the children of the desolate--more than of her having the husband.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> but as then he who was born according to the flesh did persecute him according to the spirit, so also now;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> but what saith the Writing? `Cast forth the maid-servant and her son, for the son of the maid-servant may not be heir with the son of the free-woman;'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> then, brethren, we are not a maid-servant's children, but the free-woman's.</p>
