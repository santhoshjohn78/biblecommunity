<h2>Joshua 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it cometh to pass, when all the nation hath completed to pass over the Jordan, that Jehovah speaketh unto Joshua, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Take for you out of the people twelve men, one man--one man out of a tribe;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and command ye them, saying, Take up for you from this [place], from the midst of the Jordan, from the established standing-place of the feet of the priests, twelve stones, and ye have removed them over with you, and placed them in the lodging-place in which ye lodge to-night.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Joshua calleth unto the twelve men whom he prepared out of the sons of Israel, one man--one man out of a tribe;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and Joshua saith to them, `Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God unto the midst of the Jordan and lift up for you each, one stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> so that this is a sign in your midst, when your children ask hereafter, saying, What [are] these stones to you?</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> that ye have said to them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off, at the presence of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; in its passing over into the Jordan were the waters of the Jordan cut off; and these stones have been for a memorial to the sons of Israel--to the age.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the sons of Israel do so as Joshua commanded, and take up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah hath spoken unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and remove them over with them unto the lodging-place, and place them there,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> even the twelve stones hath Joshua raised up out of the midst of the Jordan, the place of the standing of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant, and they are there unto this day.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the priests bearing the ark are standing in the midst of the Jordan till the completion of the whole thing which Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua, and the people haste and pass over.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And it cometh to pass when all the people have completed to pass over, that the ark of Jehovah passeth over, and the priests, in the presence of the people;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, pass over, by fifties, before the sons of Israel, as Moses had spoken unto them;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> about forty thousand, armed ones of the host, passed over before Jehovah for battle, unto the plains of Jericho.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> On that day hath Jehovah made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel, and they reverence him, as they reverenced Moses, all days of his life.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Joshua, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> `Command the priests bearing the ark of the testimony, and they come up out of the Jordan.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Joshua commandeth the priests, saying, `Come ye up out of the Jordan.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And it cometh to pass, in the coming up of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the midst of the Jordan--the soles of the feet of the priests have been drawn up into the dry ground--and the waters of the Jordan turn back to their place, and go as heretofore over all its banks.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And the people have come up out of the Jordan on the tenth of the first month, and encamp in Gilgal, in the extremity east of Jericho;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and these twelve stones, which they have taken out of the Jordan, hath Joshua raised up in Gilgal.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And he speaketh unto the sons of Israel, saying, `When your sons ask their fathers hereafter, saying, What [are] these stones?</p>

<p><a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> then ye have caused your sons to know, saying, On dry land Israel passed over this Jordan;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> because Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan at your presence, till your passing over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea which He dried up at our presence till our passing over;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> so that all the people of the land do know the hand of Jehovah that it [is] strong, so that ye have reverenced Jehovah your God all the days.'</p>
