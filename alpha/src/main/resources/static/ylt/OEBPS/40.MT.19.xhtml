<h2>Matthew 19</h2>

<p><a id="c19_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these words, he removed from Galilee, and did come to the borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan,</p>

<p><a id="c19_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the Pharisees came near to him, tempting him, and saying to him, `Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he answering said to them, `Did ye not read, that He who made [them], from the beginning a male and a female made them,</p>

<p><a id="c19_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and cleave to his wife, and they shall be--the two--for one flesh?</p>

<p><a id="c19_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> so that they are no more two, but one flesh; what therefore God did join together, let no man put asunder.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> They say to him, `Why then did Moses command to give a roll of divorce, and to put her away?'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He saith to them--`Moses for your stiffness of heart did suffer you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it hath not been so.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> `And I say to you, that, whoever may put away his wife, if not for whoredom, and may marry another, doth commit adultery; and he who did marry her that hath been put away, doth commit adultery.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> His disciples say to him, `If the case of the man with the woman is so, it is not good to marry.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And he said to them, `All do not receive this word, but those to whom it hath been given;</p>

<p><a id="c19_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> for there are eunuchs who from the mother's womb were so born; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who kept themselves eunuchs because of the reign of the heavens: he who is able to receive [it] --let him receive.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Then were brought near to him children that he might put hands on them and pray, and the disciples rebuked them.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But Jesus said, `Suffer the children, and forbid them not, to come unto me, for of such is the reign of the heavens;'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and having laid on them [his] hands, he departed thence.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And lo, one having come near, said to him, `Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have life age-during?'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And he said to him, `Why me dost thou call good? no one [is] good except One-- God; but if thou dost will to enter into the life, keep the commands.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> He saith to him, `What kind?' And Jesus said, `Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness,</p>

<p><a id="c19_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> honour thy father and mother, and, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> The young man saith to him, `All these did I keep from my youth; what yet do I lack?'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Jesus said to him, `If thou dost will to be perfect, go away, sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, follow me.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And the young man, having heard the word, went away sorrowful, for he had many possessions;</p>

<p><a id="c19_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and Jesus said to his disciples, `Verily I say to you, that hardly shall a rich man enter into the reign of the heavens;</p>

<p><a id="c19_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and again I say to you, it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle to go, than for a rich man to enter into the reign of God.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And his disciples having heard, were amazed exceedingly, saying, `Who, then, is able to be saved?'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Jesus having earnestly beheld, said to them, `With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Then Peter answering said to him, `Lo, we did leave all, and follow thee, what then shall we have?'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And Jesus said to them, `Verily I say to you, that ye who did follow me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man may sit upon a throne of his glory, shall sit--ye also--upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel;</p>

<p><a id="c19_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and every one who left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for my name's sake, an hundredfold shall receive, and life age-during shall inherit;</p>

<p><a id="c19_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and many first shall be last, and last first.</p>
