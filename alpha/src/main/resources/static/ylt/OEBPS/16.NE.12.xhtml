<p><a id="c12_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and sons of the singers are gathered together even from the circuit round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and from the house of Gilgal, and from fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for villages have the singers built for themselves round about Jerusalem;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and the priests and the Levites are cleansed, and they cleanse the people, and the gates, and the wall.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And I bring up the heads of Judah upon the wall, and appoint two great thanksgiving companies and processions. At the right, on the wall, to the dung-gate;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and after them goeth Hoshaiah, and half of the heads of Judah,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> and by the gate of the fountain and over-against them, they have gone up by the steps of the city of David, at the going up of the wall beyond the house of David, and unto the water-gate eastward.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And the second thanksgiving company that is going over-against, and I after it, and half of the people on the wall from beyond the tower of the furnaces and unto the broad wall,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> and from beyond the gate of Ephraim, and by the old-gate, and by the fish-gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, and unto the sheep-gate--and they have stood at the prison-gate.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And the two thanksgiving companies stand in the house of God, and I and half of the prefects with me,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah, with trumpets,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> and Masseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer, and the singers sound, and Jezrahiah the inspector;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> and they sacrifice on that day great sacrifices and rejoice, for God hath made them rejoice [with] great joy, and also, the women and the children have rejoiced, and the joy of Jerusalem is heard--unto a distance.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> And certain are appointed on that day over the chambers for treasures, for heaveofferings, for first-fruits, and for tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for priests, and for Levites, for the joy of Judah [is] over the priests, and over the Levites, who are standing up.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> And the singers and the gatekeepers keep the charge of their God, even the charge of the cleansing--according to the command of David [and] Solomon his son,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> for in the days of David and Asaph of old [were] heads of the singers, and a song of praise and thanksgiving to God.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, are giving the portions of the singers, and of the gatekeepers, the matter of a day in its day, and are sanctifying to the Levites, and the Levites are sanctifying to the sons of Aaron.</p>
