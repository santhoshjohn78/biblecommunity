<h2>Psalms 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To the Overseer, `On the Gittith.' A Psalm of David. Jehovah, our Lord, How honourable Thy name in all the earth! Who settest thine honour on the heavens.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> From the mouths of infants and sucklings Thou hast founded strength, Because of Thine adversaries, To still an enemy and a self-avenger.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For I see Thy heavens, a work of Thy fingers, Moon and stars that Thou didst establish.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> What [is] man that Thou rememberest him? The son of man that Thou inspectest him?</p>

<p><a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And causest him to lack a little of Godhead, And with honour and majesty compassest him.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thou dost cause him to rule Over the works of Thy hands, All Thou hast placed under his feet.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Sheep and oxen, all of them, And also beasts of the field,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Bird of the heavens, and fish of the sea, Passing through the paths of the seas!</p>

<p><a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Jehovah, our Lord, How honourable Thy name in all the earth!</p>
