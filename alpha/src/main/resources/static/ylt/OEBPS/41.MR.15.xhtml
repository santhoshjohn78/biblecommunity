<h2>Mark 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And immediately, in the morning, the chief priests having made a consultation, with the elders, and scribes, and the whole sanhedrim, having bound Jesus, did lead away, and delivered [him] to Pilate;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and Pilate questioned him, `Art thou the king of the Jews?' and he answering said to him, `Thou dost say [it].'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the chief priests were accusing him of many things, [but he answered nothing.]</p>

<p><a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Pilate again questioned him, saying, `Thou dost not answer anything! lo, how many things they do testify against thee!'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and Jesus did no more answer anything, so that Pilate wondered.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And at every feast he was releasing to them one prisoner, whomsoever they were asking;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and there was [one] named Barabbas, bound with those making insurrection with him, who had in the insurrection committed murder.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the multitude having cried out, began to ask for themselves as he was always doing to them,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and Pilate answered them, saying, `Will ye [that] I shall release to you the king of the Jews?'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for he knew that because of envy the chief priests had delivered him up;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and the chief priests did move the multitude, that he might rather release Barabbas to them.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Pilate answering, again said to them, `What, then, will ye [that] I shall do to him whom ye call king of the Jews?'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and they again cried out, `Crucify him.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Pilate said to them, `Why--what evil did he?' and they cried out the more vehemently, `Crucify him;'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus--having scourged [him] --that he might be crucified.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the soldiers led him away into the hall, which is Praetorium, and call together the whole band,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and clothe him with purple, and having plaited a crown of thorns, they put [it] on him,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and began to salute him, `Hail, King of the Jews.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And they were smiting him on the head with a reed, and were spitting on him, and having bent the knee, were bowing to him,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and when they [had] mocked him, they took the purple from off him, and clothed him in his own garments, and they led him forth, that they may crucify him.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And they impress a certain one passing by--Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus--that he may bear his cross,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, `Place of a skull;'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and they were giving him to drink wine mingled with myrrh, and he did not receive.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And having crucified him, they were dividing his garments, casting a lot upon them, what each may take;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and it was the third hour, and they crucified him;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and the inscription of his accusation was written above--`The King of the Jews.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And with him they crucify two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on his left,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and the Writing was fulfilled that is saying, `And with lawless ones he was numbered.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And those passing by were speaking evil of him, shaking their heads, and saying, `Ah, the thrower down of the sanctuary, and in three days the builder!</p>

<p><a id="c15_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> save thyself, and come down from the cross!'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And in like manner also the chief priests, mocking with one another, with the scribes, said, `Others he saved; himself he is not able to save.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> The Christ! the king of Israel--let him come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe;' and those crucified with him were reproaching him.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And the sixth hour having come, darkness came over the whole land till the ninth hour,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice, saying, `Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabachthani?' which is, being interpreted, `My God, my God, why didst Thou forsake me?'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And certain of those standing by, having heard, said, `Lo, Elijah he doth call;'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> and one having run, and having filled a spunge with vinegar, having put [it] also on a reed, was giving him to drink, saying, `Let alone, let us see if Elijah doth come to take him down.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And Jesus having uttered a loud cry, yielded the spirit,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and the veil of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to bottom,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> and the centurion who was standing over-against him, having seen that, having so cried out, he yielded the spirit, said, `Truly this man was Son of God.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And there were also women afar off beholding, among whom was also Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James the less, and of Joses, and Salome,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> (who also, when he was in Galilee, were following him, and were ministering to him,) and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> And now evening having come, seeing it was the preparation, that is, the foresabbath,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> Joseph of Arimathea, an honourable counsellor, who also himself was waiting for the reign of God, came, boldly entered in unto Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> And Pilate wondered if he were already dead, and having called near the centurion, did question him if he were long dead,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> and having known [it] from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> And he, having brought fine linen, and having taken him down, wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that had been hewn out of a rock, and he rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> and Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of Joses, were beholding where he is laid.</p>
