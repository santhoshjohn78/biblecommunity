<h2>1 Timothy 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I exhort, then, first of all, there be made supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, for all men:</p>

<p><a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> for kings, and all who are in authority, that a quiet and peaceable life we may lead in all piety and gravity,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> for this [is] right and acceptable before God our Saviour,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> who doth will all men to be saved, and to come to the full knowledge of the truth;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> for one [is] God, one also [is] mediator of God and of men, the man Christ Jesus,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> who did give himself a ransom for all--the testimony in its own times--</p>

<p><a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle--truth I say in Christ, I do not lie--a teacher of nations, in faith and truth.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I wish, therefore, that men pray in every place, lifting up kind hands, apart from anger and reasoning;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> in like manner also the women, in becoming apparel, with modesty and sobriety to adorn themselves, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or garments of great price,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> but--which becometh women professing godly piety--through good works.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and a woman I do not suffer to teach, nor to rule a husband, but to be in quietness,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> for Adam was first formed, then Eve,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, into transgression came,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.</p>
