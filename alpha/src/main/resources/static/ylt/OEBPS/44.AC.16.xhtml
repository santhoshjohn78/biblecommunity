<h2>Acts 16</h2>

<p><a id="c16_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And he came to Derbe and Lystra, and lo, a certain disciple was there, by name Timotheus son of a certain woman, a believing Jewess, but of a father, a Greek,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> who was well testified to by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium;</p>

<p><a id="c16_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> this one did Paul wish to go forth with him, and having taken [him], he circumcised him, because of the Jews who are in those places, for they all knew his father--that he was a Greek.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And as they were going on through the cities, they were delivering to them the decrees to keep, that have been judged by the apostles and the elders who [are] in Jerusalem,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> then, indeed, were the assemblies established in the faith, and were abounding in number every day;</p>

<p><a id="c16_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and having gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> having gone toward Mysia, they were trying to go on toward Bithynia, and the Spirit did not suffer them,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and having passed by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And a vision through the night appeared to Paul--a certain man of Macedonia was standing, calling upon him, and saying, `Having passed through to Macedonia, help us;' --</p>

<p><a id="c16_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and when he saw the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go forth to Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord hath called us to preach good news to them,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> having set sail, therefore, from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, on the morrow also to Neapolis,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> thence also to Philippi, which is a principal city of the part of Macedonia--a colony. And we were in this city abiding certain days,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> on the sabbath-day also we went forth outside of the city, by a river, where there used to be prayer, and having sat down, we were speaking to the women who came together,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, was hearing, whose heart the Lord did open to attend to the things spoken by Paul;</p>

<p><a id="c16_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and when she was baptized, and her household, she did call upon us, saying, `If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, having entered into my house, remain;' and she constrained us.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And it came to pass in our going on to prayer, a certain maid, having a spirit of Python, did meet us, who brought much employment to her masters by soothsaying,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> she having followed Paul and us, was crying, saying, `These men are servants of the Most High God, who declare to us a way of salvation;'</p>

<p><a id="c16_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and this she was doing for many days, but Paul having been grieved, and having turned, said to the spirit, `I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come forth from her;' and it came forth the same hour.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And her masters having seen that the hope of their employment was gone, having caught Paul and Silas, drew [them] to the market-place, unto the rulers,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and having brought them to the magistrates, they said, `These men do exceedingly trouble our city, being Jews;</p>

<p><a id="c16_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and they proclaim customs that are not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being</p>

<p><a id="c16_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates having torn their garments from them, were commanding to beat [them] with rods,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> many blows also having laid upon them, they cast them to prison, having given charge to the jailor to keep them safely,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> who such a charge having received, did put them to the inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And at midnight Paul and Silas praying, were singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were hearing them,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and suddenly a great earthquake came, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, opened also presently were all the doors, and of all--the bands were loosed;</p>

<p><a id="c16_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and the jailor having come out of sleep, and having seen the doors of the prison open, having drawn a sword, was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to be fled,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, `Thou mayest not do thyself any harm, for we are all here.'</p>

<p><a id="c16_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And, having asked for a light, he sprang in, and trembling he fell down before Paul and Silas,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and having brought them forth, said, `Sirs, what must I do--that I may be saved?'</p>

<p><a id="c16_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and they said, `Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved--thou and thy house;'</p>

<p><a id="c16_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and they spake to him the word of the Lord, and to all those in his household;</p>

<p><a id="c16_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> and having taken them, in that hour of the night, he did bathe [them] from the blows, and was baptized, himself and all his presently,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> having brought them also into his house, he set food before [them], and was glad with all the household, he having believed in God.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And day having come, the magistrates sent the rod-bearers, saying, `Let those men go;'</p>

<p><a id="c16_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> and the jailor told these words unto Paul--`The magistrates have sent, that ye may be let go; now, therefore, having gone forth go on in peace;'</p>

<p><a id="c16_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> and Paul said to them, `Having beaten us publicly uncondemned--men, Romans being-- they did cast [us] to prison, and now privately do they cast us forth! why no! but having come themselves, let them bring us forth.'</p>

<p><a id="c16_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And the rod-bearers told to the magistrates these sayings, and they were afraid, having heard that they are Romans,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> and having come, they besought them, and having brought [them] forth, they were asking [them] to go forth from the city;</p>

<p><a id="c16_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> and they, having gone forth out of the prison, entered into [the house of] Lydia, and having seen the brethren, they comforted them, and went forth.</p>
