<h2>Numbers 18</h2>

<p><a id="c18_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah saith unto Aaron, `Thou, and thy sons, and the house of thy father with thee, do bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou, and thy sons with thee, do bear the iniquity of your priesthood;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and also thy brethren, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring near with thee, and they are joined unto thee, and serve thee, even thou and thy sons with thee, before the tent of the testimony.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> `And they have kept thy charge, and the charge of all the tent; only, unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar they do not come near, and they die not, either they or you;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and they have been joined unto thee, and have kept the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; and a stranger doth not come near unto you;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and ye have kept the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar, and there is no more wrath against the sons of Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> `And I, lo, I have taken your brethren the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel; to you a gift they are given by Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and thou, and thy sons with thee, do keep your priesthood, for everything of the altar, and within the vail, and ye have served; a service of gift I make your priesthood; and the stranger who is coming near is put to death.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Aaron: `And I, lo, I have given to thee the charge of My heave-offerings, of all the hallowed things of the sons of Israel--to thee I have given them for the anointing, and to thy sons, by a statute age-during.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> This is thine of the most holy things, from the fire: all their offering, to all their present, and to all their sin-offering, and to all their guilt-offering, which they give back to Me, is most holy to thee, and to thy sons;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> in the holy of holies thou dost eat it; every male doth eat it; holy it is to thee.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> `And this [is] thine: the heave-offering of their gift, to all the wave-offerings of the sons of Israel, to thee I have given them, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute age-during; every clean one in thy house doth eat it;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> all the best of the oil, and all the best of the new wine, and wheat--their first - [fruits] which they give to Jehovah--to thee I have given them.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> `The first-fruits of all that [is] in their land, which they bring in to Jehovah, are thine; every clean one in thy house doth eat it;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> every devoted thing in Israel is thine,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> every one opening a womb of all flesh which they bring near to Jehovah, among man and among beast, is thine; only, thou dost certainly ransom the first-born of man, and the firstling of the unclean beast thou dost ransom.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> `And their ransomed ones from a son of a month, thou dost ransom with thy valuation, of silver, five shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary, twenty gerahs it [is].</p>

<p><a id="c18_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> `Only, the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou dost not ransom, holy they [are]: their blood thou dost sprinkle on the altar, and of their fat thou makest perfume, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and their flesh is thine, as the breast of the wave-offering, and as the right leg, it is thine;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> all the heave-offerings of the holy things which the sons of Israel lift up to Jehovah I have given to thee and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute ageduring, a covenant of salt, age-during it [is] before Jehovah, to thee and to thy seed with thee.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Jehovah saith unto Aaron, `In their land thou dost not inherit, and a portion thou hast not in their midst: I [am] thy portion, and thine inheritance in the midst of the sons of Israel;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and to the sons of Levi, lo, I have given all the tenth in Israel for inheritance in exchange for their service which they are serving--the service of the tent of meeting.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> `And the sons of Israel come no more near unto the tent of meeting, to bear sin, to die,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and the Levites have done the service of the tent of meeting, and they--they bear their iniquity; a statute age-during to your generations, that in the midst of the sons of Israel they have no inheritance;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> but the tithe of the sons of Israel which they lift up to Jehovah, a heave-offering, I have given to the Levites for inheritance; therefore I have said of them, In the midst of the sons of Israel they have no inheritance.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> `And unto the Levites thou dost speak; and thou hast said unto them, When ye take from the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given to you from them, for your inheritance, then ye have lifted up from it the heave-offering of Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and your heave-offering hath been reckoned to you as corn from the threshingfloor, and as fulness from the wine-vat;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> so ye do lift up--ye also--the heave-offering of Jehovah from all your tithes which ye receive from the sons of Israel; and ye have given from it the heave-offering of Jehovah to Aaron the priest;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> out of all your gifts ye do lift up the whole heave-offering of Jehovah; out of all its fat, --its hallowed part--out of it.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> `And thou hast said unto them, In your lifting up its fat out of it, then it hath been reckoned to the Levites, as increase of a threshing-floor, and as increase of a wine-vat;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and ye have eaten it in every place, ye and your households, for it [is] your hire in exchange for your service in the tent of meeting;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and ye bear no sin for it, in your lifting up its fat out of it, and the holy things of the sons of Israel ye do not pollute, and ye die not.'</p>
