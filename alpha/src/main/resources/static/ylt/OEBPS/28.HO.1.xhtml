<h2>Hosea 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A word of Jehovah that hath been unto Hosea, son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel:</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The commencement of Jehovah's speaking by Hosea. And Jehovah saith unto Hosea, `Go, take to thee a woman of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms, for utterly go a-whoring doth the land from after Jehovah.'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he goeth and taketh Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceiveth and beareth to him a son;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and Jehovah saith unto him, `Call his name Jezreel, for yet a little, and I have charged the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and have caused to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and it hath come to pass in that day that I have broken the bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And she conceiveth again, and beareth a daughter, and He saith to him, `Call her name Lo-Ruhamah, for I add no more to pity the house of Israel, for I do utterly take them away;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and the house of Judah I pity, and have saved them by Jehovah their God, and do not save them by bow, and by sword, and by battle, by horses, and by horsemen.'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And she weaneth Lo-Ruhamah, and conceiveth, and beareth a son;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and He saith, `Call his name Lo-Ammi, for ye [are] not My people, and I am not for you;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and the number of the sons of Israel hath been as the sand of the sea, that is not measured nor numbered, and it hath come to pass in the place where it is said to them, Ye [are] not My people, it is said to them, Sons of the Living God;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and gathered have been the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel together, and they have appointed to themselves one head, and have gone up from the land, for great [is] the day of Jezreel.</p>
