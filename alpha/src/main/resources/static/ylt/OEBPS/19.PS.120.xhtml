<h2>Psalms 120</h2>

<p><a id="c120_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Song of the Ascents. Unto Jehovah in my distress I have called, And He answereth me.</p>

<p><a id="c120_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> O Jehovah, deliver my soul from a lying lip, From a deceitful tongue!</p>

<p><a id="c120_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> What doth He give to thee? And what doth He add to thee? O deceitful tongue!</p>

<p><a id="c120_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Sharp arrows of a mighty one, with broom-coals.</p>

<p><a id="c120_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Woe to me, for I have inhabited Mesech, I have dwelt with tents of Kedar.</p>

<p><a id="c120_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Too much hath my soul dwelt with him who is hating peace.</p>

<p><a id="c120_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I [am] peace, and when I speak they [are] for war!</p>
