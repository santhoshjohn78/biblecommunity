<h2>Acts 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And in these days, the disciples multiplying, there came a murmuring of the Hellenists at the Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily ministration,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and the twelve, having called near the multitude of the disciples, said, `It is not pleasing that we, having left the word of God, do minister at tables;</p>

<p><a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> look out, therefore, brethren, seven men of you who are well testified of, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may set over this necessity,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and we to prayer, and to the ministration of the word, will give ourselves continually.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the thing was pleasing before all the multitude, and they did choose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> whom they did set before the apostles, and they, having prayed, laid on them [their] hands.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the word of God did increase, and the number of the disciples did multiply in Jerusalem exceedingly; a great multitude also of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Stephen, full of faith and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and there arose certain of those of the synagogue, called of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia, and Asia, disputing with Stephen,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking;</p>

<p><a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> then they suborned men, saying--`We have heard him speaking evil sayings in regard to Moses and God.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> They did stir up also the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and having come upon [him], they caught him, and brought [him] to the sanhedrim;</p>

<p><a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> they set up also false witnesses, saying, `This one doth not cease to speak evil sayings against this holy place and the law,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> for we have heard him saying, That this Jesus the Nazarean shall overthrow this place, and shall change the customs that Moses delivered to us;'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and gazing at him, all those sitting in the sanhedrim saw his face as it were the face of a messenger.</p>
