<h2>Matthew 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And when he came down from the mount, great multitudes did follow him,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and lo, a leper having come, was bowing to him, saying, `Sir, if thou art willing, thou art able to cleanse me;'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and having stretched forth the hand, Jesus touched him, saying, `I will, be thou cleansed,' and immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Jesus saith to him, `See, thou mayest tell no one, but go, thyself shew to the priest, and bring the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony to them.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Jesus having entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion calling upon him,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and saying, `Sir, my young man hath been laid in the house a paralytic, fearfully afflicted,'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and Jesus saith to him, `I, having come, will heal him.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the centurion answering said, `Sir, I am not worthy that thou mayest enter under my roof, but only say a word, and my servant shall be healed;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for I also am a man under authority, having under myself soldiers, and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Be coming, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doth [it].'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Jesus having heard, did wonder, and said to those following, `Verily I say to you, not even in Israel so great faith have I found;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and I say to you, that many from east and west shall come and recline (at meat) with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the reign of the heavens,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> but the sons of the reign shall be cast forth to the outer darkness--there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Jesus said to the centurion, `Go, and as thou didst believe let it be to thee;' and his young man was healed in that hour.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Jesus having come into the house of Peter, saw his mother-in-law laid, and fevered,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she arose, and was ministering to them.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And evening having come, they brought to him many demoniacs, and he did cast out the spirits with a word, and did heal all who were ill,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, `Himself took our infirmities, and the sicknesses he did bear.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Jesus having seen great multitudes about him, did command to depart to the other side;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and a certain scribe having come, said to him, `Teacher, I will follow thee wherever thou mayest go;'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and Jesus saith to him, `The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven places of rest, but the Son of Man hath not where he may lay the head.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And another of his disciples said to him, `Sir, permit me first to depart and to bury my father;'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and Jesus said to him, `Follow me, and suffer the dead to bury their own dead.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And when he entered into the boat his disciples did follow him,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and lo, a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves, but he was sleeping,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and his disciples having come to him, awoke him, saying, `Sir, save us; we are perishing.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And he saith to them, `Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?' Then having risen, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and the men wondered, saying, `What kind--is this, that even the wind and the sea do obey him?'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And he having come to the other side, to the region of the Gergesenes, there met him two demoniacs, coming forth out of the tombs, very fierce, so that no one was able to pass over by that way,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and lo, they cried out, saying, `What--to us and to thee, Jesus, Son of God? didst thou come hither, before the time, to afflict us?'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And there was far off from them a herd of many swine feeding,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and the demons were calling on him, saying, `If thou dost cast us forth, permit us to go away to the herd of the swine;'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and he saith to them, `Go.' And having come forth, they went to the herd of the swine, and lo, the whole herd of the swine rushed down the steep, to the sea, and died in the waters,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> and those feeding did flee, and, having gone to the city, they declared all, and the matter of the demoniacs.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And lo, all the city came forth to meet Jesus, and having seen him, they called on [him] that he might depart from their borders.</p>
