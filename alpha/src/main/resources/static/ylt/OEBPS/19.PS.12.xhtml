<h2>Psalms 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To the Overseer, on the octave. --A Psalm of David. Save, Jehovah, for the saintly hath failed, For the stedfast have ceased From the sons of men:</p>

<p><a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Vanity they speak each with his neighbour, Lip of flattery! With heart and heart they speak.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jehovah doth cut off all lips of flattery, A tongue speaking great things,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Who said, `By our tongue we do mightily: Our lips [are] our own; who [is] lord over us?'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Because of the spoiling of the poor, Because of the groaning of the needy, Now do I arise, saith Jehovah, I set in safety [him who] doth breathe for it.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Sayings of Jehovah [are] pure sayings; Silver tried in a furnace of earth refined sevenfold.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Thou, O Jehovah, dost preserve them, Thou keepest us from this generation to the age.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Around the wicked walk continually, According as vileness is exalted by sons of men!</p>
