<h2>Psalms 75</h2>

<p><a id="c75_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To the Overseer. --`Destroy not.' --A Psalm of Asaph. --A Song. We have given thanks to Thee, O God, We have given thanks, and near [is] Thy name, They have recounted Thy wonders.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> When I receive an appointment, I--I do judge uprightly.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Melted is the earth and all its inhabitants, I--I have pondered its pillars. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I have said to the boastful, `Be not boastful,' And to the wicked, `Raise not up a horn.'</p>

<p><a id="c75_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Raise not up on high your horn, (Ye speak with a stiff neck.)</p>

<p><a id="c75_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For not from the east, or from the west, Nor from the wilderness--[is] elevation.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But God [is] judge, This He maketh low--and this He lifteth up.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For a cup [is] in the hand of Jehovah, And the wine hath foamed, It is full of mixture, and He poureth out of it, Only its dregs wring out, and drink, Do all the wicked of the earth,</p>

<p><a id="c75_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And I--I declare [it] to the age, I sing praise to the God of Jacob.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And all horns of the wicked I cut off, Exalted are the horns of the righteous!</p>
