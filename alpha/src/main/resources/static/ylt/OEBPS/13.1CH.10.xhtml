<h2>1 Chronicles 10</h2>

<p><a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the Philistines have fought with Israel, and the men of Israel flee from the face of the Philistines, and fall wounded in mount Gilboa,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and the Philistines pursue after Saul, and after his sons, and the Philistines smite Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-Shua, sons of Saul.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the battle [is] heavy on Saul, and those shooting with the bow find him, and he is wounded by those shooting,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and Saul saith unto the bearer of his weapons, `Draw thy sword, and pierce me with it, lest these uncircumcised come--and have abused me.' And the bearer of his weapons hath not been willing, for he feareth exceedingly, and Saul taketh the sword, and falleth upon it;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and the bearer of his weapons seeth that Saul [is] dead, and falleth, he also, on the sword, and dieth;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and Saul dieth, and his three sons, and all his house--together they died.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And all the men of Israel who [are] in the valley see that they have fled, and that Saul and his sons have died, and they forsake their cities and flee, and the Philistines come and dwell in them.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that the Philistines come to strip the wounded, and find Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and strip him, and bear away his head, and his weapons, and send into the land of the Philistines round about to proclaim tidings [to] their idols and the people,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and put his weapons in the house of their gods, and his skull they have fixed in the house of Dagon.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And all Jabesh-Gilead hear of all that the Philistines have done to Saul,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and all the men of valour rise and bear away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and bring them in to Jabesh, and bury their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fast seven days.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Saul dieth because of his trespass that he trespassed against Jehovah, against the word of Jehovah that he kept not, and also for asking at a familiar spirit--to inquire, --</p>

<p><a id="c10_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and he inquired not at Jehovah, and He putteth him to death, and turneth round the kingdom to David son of Jesse.</p>
