<h2>Psalms 141</h2>

<p><a id="c141_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm, by David. O Jehovah, I have called Thee, haste to me, Give ear [to] my voice when I call to Thee.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> My prayer is prepared--incense before Thee, The lifting up of my hands--the evening present.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Set, O Jehovah, a watch for my mouth, Watch Thou over the door of my lips.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Incline not my heart to an evil thing, To do habitually actions in wickedness, With men working iniquity, Yea, I eat not of their pleasant things.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The righteous doth beat me [in] kindness. And doth reprove me, Oil of the head my head disalloweth not, For still my prayer [is] about their vexations.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Their judges have been released by the sides of a rock, And they have heard my sayings, For they have been pleasant.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> As one tilling and ripping up in the land, Have our bones been scattered at the command of Saul.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But to Thee, O Jehovah, my Lord, [are] mine eyes, In Thee I have trusted, Make not bare my soul.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Keep me from the gin they laid for me, Even snares of workers of iniquity.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The wicked fall in their nets together, till I pass over!</p>
