<h2>Romans 13</h2>

<p><a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Let every soul to the higher authorities be subject, for there is no authority except from God, and the authorities existing are appointed by God,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> so that he who is setting himself against the authority, against God's ordinance hath resisted; and those resisting, to themselves shall receive judgment.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For those ruling are not a terror to the good works, but to the evil; and dost thou wish not to be afraid of the authority? that which is good be doing, and thou shalt have praise from it,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> for of God it is a ministrant to thee for good; and if that which is evil thou mayest do, be fearing, for not in vain doth it bear the sword; for of God it is a ministrant, an avenger for wrath to him who is doing that which is evil.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Wherefore it is necessary to be subject, not only because of the wrath, but also because of the conscience,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> for because of this also pay ye tribute; for servants of God they are, on this very thing attending continually;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> render, therefore, to all [their] dues; to whom tribute, the tribute; to whom custom, the custom; to whom fear, the fear; to whom honour, the honour.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> To no one owe anything, except to love one another; for he who is loving the other-- law he hath fulfilled,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for, `Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false testimony, Thou shalt not covet;' and if there is any other command, in this word it is summed up, in this: `Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> the love to the neighbour doth work no ill; the love, therefore, [is] the fulness of law.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And this, knowing the time, that for us, the hour already [is] to be aroused out of sleep, for now nearer [is] our salvation than when we did believe;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> the night did advance, and the day came nigh; let us lay aside, therefore, the works of the darkness, and let us put on the armour of the light;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> as in day-time, let us walk becomingly; not in revellings and drunkennesses, not in chamberings and lasciviousnesses, not in strife and emulation;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and for the flesh take no forethought--for desires.</p>
