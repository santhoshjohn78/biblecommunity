<h2>Revelation 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And there came one of the seven messengers, who were having the seven vials, and he spake with me, saying to me, `Come, I will shew to thee the judgment of the great whore, who is sitting upon the many waters,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> with whom the kings of the earth did commit whoredom; and made drunk from the wine of her whoredom were those inhabiting the earth;'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and he carried me away to a wilderness in the Spirit, and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of evil-speaking, having seven heads and ten horns,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and the woman was arrayed with purple and scarlet-colour, and gilded with gold, and precious stone, and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and uncleanness of her whoredom,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and upon her forehead was a name written: `Secret, Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Whores, and the Abominations of the earth.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I saw the woman drunken from the blood of the saints, and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus, and I did wonder--having seen her--with great wonder;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and the messenger said to me, `Wherefore didst thou wonder? I--I will tell thee the secret of the woman and of the beast that [is] carrying her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> `The beast that thou didst see: it was, and it is not; and it is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go away to destruction, and wonder shall those dwelling upon the earth, whose names have not been written upon the scroll of the life from the foundation of the world, beholding the beast that was, and is not, although it is.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> `Here [is] the mind that is having wisdom; the seven heads are seven mountains, upon which the woman doth sit,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and there are seven kings, the five did fall, and the one is, the other did not yet come, and when he may come, it behoveth him to remain a little time;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and the beast that was, and is not, he also is eighth, and out of the seven he is, and to destruction he doth go away.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> `And the ten horns that thou sawest, are ten kings, who a kingdom did not yet receive, but authority as kings the same hour do receive with the beast,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> these have one mind, and their own power and authority to the beast they shall give over;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> these with the Lamb shall make war, and the Lamb shall overcome them, because Lord of lords he is, and King of kings, and those with him are called, and choice, and stedfast.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he saith to me, `The waters that thou didst see, where the whore doth sit, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues;'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and the ten horns that thou didst see upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her in fire,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> for God did give into their hearts to do its mind, and to make one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast till the sayings of God may be complete,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and the woman that thou didst see is the great city that is having reign over the kings of the land.'</p>
