<h2>Psalms 76</h2>

<p><a id="c76_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To the Overseer with stringed instruments. --A Psalm of Asaph. --A Song. In Judah [is] God known, in Israel His name [is] great.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And His tabernacle is in Salem, And His habitation in Zion.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> There he hath shivered arrows of a bow, Shield, and sword, and battle. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Bright [art] Thou, honourable above hills of prey.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Spoiled themselves have the mighty of heart, They have slept their sleep, And none of the men of might found their hands.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> From Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both rider and horse have been fast asleep.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Thou, fearful [art] Thou, And who doth stand before Thee, Since Thou hast been angry!</p>

<p><a id="c76_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> From heaven Thou hast sounded judgment, Earth hath feared, and hath been still,</p>

<p><a id="c76_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> In the rising of God to judgment, To save all the humble of earth. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For the fierceness of man praiseth Thee, The remnant of fierceness Thou girdest on.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Vow and complete to Jehovah your God, All ye surrounding him. They bring presents to the Fearful One.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> He doth gather the spirit of leaders, Fearful to the kings of earth!</p>
