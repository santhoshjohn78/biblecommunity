<h2>Matthew 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then come unto Jesus do they from Jerusalem--scribes and Pharisees--saying,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Wherefore do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they do not wash their hands when they may eat bread.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he answering said to them, `Wherefore also do ye transgress the command of God because of your tradition?</p>

<p><a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> for God did command, saying, Honour thy father and mother; and, He who is speaking evil of father or mother--let him die the death;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> but ye say, Whoever may say to father or mother, An offering [is] whatever thou mayest be profited by me; --</p>

<p><a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and he may not honour his father or his mother, and ye did set aside the command of God because of your tradition.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `Hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> This people doth draw nigh to Me with their mouth, and with the lips it doth honour Me, but their heart is far off from Me;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and in vain do they worship Me, teaching teachings--commands of men.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And having called near the multitude, he said to them, `Hear and understand:</p>

<p><a id="c15_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> not that which is coming into the mouth doth defile the man, but that which is coming forth from the mouth, this defileth the man.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Then his disciples having come near, said to him, `Hast thou known that the Pharisees, having heard the word, were stumbled?'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he answering said, `Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant shall be rooted up;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> let them alone, guides they are--blind of blind; and if blind may guide blind, both into a ditch shall fall.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Peter answering said to him, `Explain to us this simile.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Jesus said, `Are ye also yet without understanding?</p>

<p><a id="c15_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> do ye not understand that all that is going into the mouth doth pass into the belly, and into the drain is cast forth?</p>

<p><a id="c15_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> but the things coming forth from the mouth from the heart do come forth, and these defile the man;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, whoredoms, thefts, false witnessings, evil speakings:</p>

<p><a id="c15_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> these are the things defiling the man; but to eat with unwashen hands doth not defile the man.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Jesus having come forth thence, withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and lo, a woman, a Canaanitess, from those borders having come forth, did call to him, saying, `Deal kindly with me, Sir--Son of David; my daughter is miserably demonized.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And he did not answer her a word; and his disciples having come to him, were asking him, saying--`Let her away, because she crieth after us;'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and he answering said, `I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And having come, she was bowing to him, saying, `Sir, help me;'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and he answering said, `It is not good to take the children's bread, and to cast to the little dogs.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And she said, `Yes, sir, for even the little dogs do eat of the crumbs that are falling from their lords' table;'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> then answering, Jesus said to her, `O woman, great [is] thy faith, let it be to thee as thou wilt;' and her daughter was healed from that hour.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Jesus having passed thence, came nigh unto the sea of Galilee, and having gone up to the mountain, he was sitting there,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and there came to him great multitudes, having with them lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they did cast them at the feet of Jesus, and he healed them,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> so that the multitudes did wonder, seeing dumb ones speaking, maimed whole, lame walking, and blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And Jesus having called near his disciples, said, `I have compassion upon the multitude, because now three days they continue with me, and they have not what they may eat; and to let them away fasting I will not, lest they faint in the way.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And his disciples say to him, `Whence to us, in a wilderness, so many loaves, as to fill so great a multitude?'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And Jesus saith to them, `How many loaves have ye?' and they said, `Seven, and a few little fishes.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And he commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the ground,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, having given thanks, he did break, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And they did all eat, and were filled, and they took up what was over of the broken pieces seven baskets full,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and those eating were four thousand men, apart from women and children.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And having let away the multitudes, he went into the boat, and did come to the borders of Magdala.</p>
