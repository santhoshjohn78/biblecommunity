<h2>Numbers 24</h2>

<p><a id="c24_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Balaam seeth that [it is] good in the eyes of Jehovah to bless Israel, and he hath not gone as time by time to meet enchantments, and he setteth towards the wilderness his face;</p>

<p><a id="c24_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and Balaam lifteth up his eyes, and seeth Israel tabernacling, by its tribes, and the Spirit of God is upon him,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and he taketh up his simile, and saith: `An affirmation of Balaam son of Beor--And an affirmation of the man whose eyes are shut--</p>

<p><a id="c24_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> An affirmation of him who is hearing sayings of God--Who a vision of the Almighty seeth, Falling--and eyes uncovered:</p>

<p><a id="c24_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> How good have been thy tents, O Jacob, Thy tabernacles, O Israel;</p>

<p><a id="c24_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> As valleys they have been stretched out, As gardens by a river; As aloes Jehovah hath planted, As cedars by waters;</p>

<p><a id="c24_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He maketh water flow from his buckets, And his seed [is] in many waters; And higher than Agag [is] his king, And exalted is his kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> God is bringing him out of Egypt; As the swiftness of a Reem is to him, He eateth up nations his adversaries, And their bones he breaketh, And [with] his arrows he smiteth,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He hath bent, he hath lain down as a lion, And as a lioness: who doth raise him up? He who is blessing thee [is] blessed, And he who is cursing thee [is] cursed.'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the anger of Balak burneth against Balaam, and he striketh his hands; and Balak saith unto Balaam, `To pierce mine enemies I called thee, and lo, thou hast certainly blessed- -these three times;</p>

<p><a id="c24_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and now, flee for thyself unto thy place; I have said, I do greatly honour thee, and lo, Jehovah hath kept thee back from honour.'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Balaam saith unto Balak, `Did I not also unto thy messengers whom thou hast sent unto me, speak, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> If Balak doth give to me the fulness of his house of silver and gold, I am not able to pass over the command of Jehovah, to do good or evil of mine own heart--that which Jehovah speaketh--it I speak?</p>

<p><a id="c24_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and, now, lo, I am going to my people; come, I counsel thee [concerning] that which this people doth to thy people, in the latter end of the days.'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he taketh up his simile, and saith: `An affirmation of Balaam son of Beor-- And an affirmation of the man whose eyes [are] shut--</p>

<p><a id="c24_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> An affirmation of him who is hearing sayings of God--And knowing knowledge of the Most High; A vision of the Almighty he seeth, Falling--and eyes uncovered:</p>

<p><a id="c24_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> I see it, but not now; I behold it, but not near; A star hath proceeded from Jacob, And a sceptre hath risen from Israel, And hath smitten corners of Moab, And hath destroyed all sons of Sheth.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Edom hath been a possession, And Seir hath been a possession, [for] its enemies, And Israel is doing valiantly;</p>

<p><a id="c24_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And [one] doth rule out of Jacob, And hath destroyed a remnant from Ar.'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And he seeth Amalek, and taketh up his simile, and saith: `A beginning of the Goyim [is] Amalek; And his latter end--for ever he perisheth.'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And he seeth the Kenite, and taketh up his simile, and saith: `Enduring [is] thy dwelling, And setting in a rock thy nest,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But the Kenite is for a burning; Till when doth Asshur keep thee captive?'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And he taketh up his simile, and saith: `Alas! who doth live when God doth this?</p>

<p><a id="c24_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And--ships [are] from the side of Chittim, And they have humbled Asshur, And they have humbled Eber, And it also for ever is perishing.'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Balaam riseth, and goeth, and turneth back to his place, and Balak also hath gone on his way.</p>
