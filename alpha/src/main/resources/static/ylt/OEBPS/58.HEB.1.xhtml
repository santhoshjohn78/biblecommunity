<h2>Hebrews 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In many parts, and many ways, God of old having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> in these last days did speak to us in a Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He did make the ages;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of His subsistence, bearing up also the all things by the saying of his might--through himself having made a cleansing of our sins, sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the highest,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> having become so much better than the messengers, as he did inherit a more excellent name than they.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For to which of the messengers said He ever, `My Son thou art--I to-day have begotten thee?' and again, `I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world, He saith, `And let them bow before him--all messengers of God;'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and unto the messengers, indeed, He saith, `Who is making His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and unto the Son: `Thy throne, O God, [is] to the age of the age; a sceptre of righteousness [is] the sceptre of thy reign;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> thou didst love righteousness, and didst hate lawlessness; because of this did He anoint thee--God, thy God--with oil of gladness above thy partners;'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and, `Thou, at the beginning, Lord, the earth didst found, and a work of thy hands are the heavens;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> these shall perish, and Thou dost remain, and all, as a garment, shall become old,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together, and they shall be changed, and Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And unto which of the messengers said He ever, `Sit at My right hand, till I may make thine enemies thy footstool?'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> are they not all spirits of service--for ministration being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?</p>
