<h2>Psalms 149</h2>

<p><a id="c149_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise ye Jah! Sing ye to Jehovah a new song, His praise in an assembly of saints.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Israel doth rejoice in his Maker, Sons of Zion do joy in their king.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> They praise His name in a dance, With timbrel and harp sing praise to Him.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For Jehovah is pleased with His people, He beautifieth the humble with salvation.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Exult do saints in honour, They sing aloud on their beds.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The exaltation of God [is] in their throat, And a two-edged sword in their hand.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> To do vengeance among nations, Punishments among the peoples.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> To bind their kings with chains, And their honoured ones with fetters of iron,</p>

<p><a id="c149_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> To do among them the judgment written, An honour it [is] for all his saints. Praise ye Jah!</p>
