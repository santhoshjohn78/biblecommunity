<h2>Hebrews 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Therefore, we also having so great a cloud of witnesses set around us, every weight having put off, and the closely besetting sin, through endurance may we run the contest that is set before us,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> looking to the author and perfecter of faith--Jesus, who, over-against the joy set before him--did endure a cross, shame having despised, on the right hand also of the throne of God did sit down;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> for consider again him who endured such gainsaying from the sinners to himself, that ye may not be wearied in your souls--being faint.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Not yet unto blood did ye resist--with the sin striving;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and ye have forgotten the exhortation that doth speak fully with you as with sons, `My son, be not despising chastening of the Lord, nor be faint, being reproved by Him,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> for whom the Lord doth love He doth chasten, and He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> if chastening ye endure, as to sons God beareth Himself to you, for who is a son whom a father doth not chasten?</p>

<p><a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and if ye are apart from chastening, of which all have become partakers, then bastards are ye, and not sons.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Then, indeed, fathers of our flesh we have had, chastising [us], and we were reverencing [them]; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of the spirits, and live?</p>

<p><a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for they, indeed, for a few days, according to what seemed good to them, were chastening, but He for profit, to be partakers of His separation;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and all chastening for the present, indeed, doth not seem to be of joy, but of sorrow, yet afterward the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those exercised through it--it doth yield.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Wherefore, the hanging-down hands and the loosened knees set ye up;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and straight paths make for your feet, that that which is lame may not be turned aside, but rather be healed;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> peace pursue with all, and the separation, apart from which no one shall see the Lord,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> looking diligently over lest any one be failing of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up may give trouble, and through this many may be defiled;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> lest any one be a fornicator, or a profane person, as Esau, who in exchange for one morsel of food did sell his birthright,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> for ye know that also afterwards, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was disapproved of, for a place of reformation he found not, though with tears having sought it.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For ye came not near to the mount touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of sayings, which those having heard did entreat that a word might not be added to them,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> for they were not bearing that which is commanded, `And if a beast may touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or with an arrow shot through,'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and, (so terrible was the sight,) Moses said, `I am fearful exceedingly, and trembling.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But, ye came to Mount Zion, and to a city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of messengers,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> to the company and assembly of the first-born in heaven enrolled, and to God the judge of all, and to spirits of righteous men made perfect,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and to a mediator of a new covenant--Jesus, and to blood of sprinkling, speaking better things than that of Abel!</p>

<p><a id="c12_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> See, may ye not refuse him who is speaking, for if those did not escape who refused him who upon earth was divinely speaking--much less we who do turn away from him who [speaketh] from heaven,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> whose voice the earth shook then, and now hath he promised, saying, `Yet once--I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven;'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and this--`Yet once' --doth make evident the removal of the things shaken, as of things having been made, that the things not shaken may remain;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> wherefore, a kingdom that cannot be shaken receiving, may we have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly, with reverence and religious fear;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> for also our God [is] a consuming fire.</p>
