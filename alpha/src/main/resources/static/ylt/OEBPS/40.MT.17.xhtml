<h2>Matthew 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, and James, and John his brother, and doth bring them up to a high mount by themselves,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and he was transfigured before them, and his face shone as the sun, and his garments did become white as the light,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and lo, appear to them did Moses and Elijah, talking together with him.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Peter answering said to Jesus, `Sir, it is good to us to be here; if thou wilt, we may make here three booths--for thee one, and for Moses one, and one for Elijah.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> While he is yet speaking, lo, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying, `This is My Son, --the Beloved, in whom I did delight; hear him.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the disciples having heard, did fall upon their face, and were exceedingly afraid,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and Jesus having come near, touched them, and said, `Rise, be not afraid,'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and having lifted up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus only.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And as they are coming down from the mount, Jesus charged them, saying, `Say to no one the vision, till the Son of Man out of the dead may rise.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And his disciples questioned him, saying, `Why then do the scribes say that Elijah it behoveth to come first?'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Jesus answering said to them, `Elijah doth indeed come first, and shall restore all things,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and I say to you--Elijah did already come, and they did not know him, but did with him whatever they would, so also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Then understood the disciples that concerning John the Baptist he spake to them.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And when they came unto the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling down to him,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and saying, `Sir, deal kindly with my son, for he is lunatic, and doth suffer miserably, for often he doth fall into the fire, and often into the water,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and I brought him near to thy disciples, and they were not able to heal him.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Jesus answering said, `O generation, unstedfast and perverse, till when shall I be with you? till when shall I bear you? bring him to me hither;'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and Jesus rebuked him, and the demon went out of him, and the lad was healed from that hour.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Then the disciples having come to Jesus by himself, said, `Wherefore were we not able to cast him out?'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Jesus said to them, `Through your want of faith; for verily I say to you, if ye may have faith as a grain of mustard, ye shall say to this mount, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible to you,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and this kind doth not go forth except in prayer and fasting.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And while they are living in Galilee, Jesus said to them, `The Son of Man is about to be delivered up to the hands of men,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise,' and they were exceeding sorry.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And they having come to Capernaum, those receiving the didrachms came near to Peter, and said, `Your teacher--doth he not pay the didrachms?' He saith, `Yes.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, `What thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth--from whom do they receive custom or poll-tax? from their sons or from the strangers?'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Peter saith to him, `From the strangers.' Jesus said to him, `Then are the sons free;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> but, that we may not cause them to stumble, having gone to the sea, cast a hook, and the fish that hath come up first take thou up, and having opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater, that having taken, give to them for me and thee.'</p>
