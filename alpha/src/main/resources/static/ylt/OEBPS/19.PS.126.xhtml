<h2>Psalms 126</h2>

<p><a id="c126_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Song of the Ascents. In Jehovah's turning back [to] the captivity of Zion, We have been as dreamers.</p>

<p><a id="c126_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Then filled [with] laughter is our mouth, And our tongue [with] singing, Then do they say among nations, `Jehovah did great things with these.'</p>

<p><a id="c126_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jehovah did great things with us, We have been joyful.</p>

<p><a id="c126_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Turn again, O Jehovah, [to] our captivity, As streams in the south.</p>

<p><a id="c126_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Those sowing in tears, with singing do reap,</p>

<p><a id="c126_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Whoso goeth on and weepeth, Bearing the basket of seed, Surely cometh in with singing, bearing his sheaves!</p>
