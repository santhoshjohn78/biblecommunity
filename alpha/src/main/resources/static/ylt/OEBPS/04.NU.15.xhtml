<h2>Numbers 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When ye come in unto the land of your dwellings, which I am giving to you,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> then ye have prepared a fire-offering to Jehovah, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, at separating a vow or free-will-offering, or in your appointed things, to make a sweet fragrance to Jehovah, out of the herd, or out of the flock.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> `And he who is bringing near his offering to Jehovah hath brought near a present of flour, a tenth deal, mixed with a fourth of the hin of oil;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and wine for a libation, a fourth of the hin thou dost prepare for the burnt-offering or for a sacrifice, for the one lamb;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> or for a ram thou dost prepare a present of flour, two-tenth deals, mixed with oil, a third of the hin;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and wine for a libation, a third part of the hin, thou dost bring near--a sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> `And when thou makest a son of the herd a burnt-offering or a sacrifice, at separating a vow or peace-offerings to Jehovah,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> then he hath brought near for the son of the herd a present of flour, three-tenth deals, mixed with oil, a half of the hin;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and wine thou bringest near for a libation, a half of the hin--a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> thus it is done for the one ox, or for the one ram, or for a lamb of the sheep or of the goats.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> `According to the number that ye prepare, so ye do to each, according to their number;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> every native doth thus with these, at bringing near a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and when a sojourner sojourneth with you, or whoso [is] in your midst to your generations, and he hath made a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah, as ye do so he doth.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> `One statute is for you of the congregation and for the sojourner who is sojourning, a statute age-during to your generations: as ye [are] so is the sojourner before Jehovah;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> one law and one ordinance is to you and to the sojourner who is sojourning with you.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, In your coming in unto the land whither I am bringing you in,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> then it hath been, in your eating of the bread of the land, ye heave up a heaveoffering to Jehovah;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> the beginning of your dough a cake ye heave up--a heave-offering; as the heaveoffering of a threshing-floor, so ye do heave it.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Of the beginning of your dough ye do give to Jehovah a heave-offering--to your generations.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> `And when ye err, and do not all these commands which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> the whole that Jehovah hath charged upon you by the hand of Moses, from the day that Jehovah hath commanded, and henceforth, to your generations,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> then it hath been, if from the eyes of the company it hath been done in ignorance, that all the company have prepared one bullock, a son of the herd, for a burnt-offering, for sweet fragrance to Jehovah, and its present, and its libation, according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> `And the priest hath made atonement for all the company of the sons of Israel, and it hath been forgiven them, for it [is] ignorance, and they--they have brought in their offering, a fire-offering to Jehovah, even their sin-offering before Jehovah for their ignorance;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and it hath been forgiven to all the company of the sons of Israel, and to the sojourner who is sojourning in their midst; for to all the company [it is done] in ignorance.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> `And if one person sin in ignorance, then he hath brought near a she-goat, daughter of a year, for a sin-offering;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and the priest hath made atonement for the person who is erring, in his sinning in ignorance before Jehovah, by making atonement for him, and it hath been forgiven him;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> for the native among the sons of Israel, and for the sojourner who is sojourning in their midst--one law is to you, for him who is doing [anything] through ignorance.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> `And the person who doth [aught] with a high hand--of the native or of the sojourner--Jehovah he is reviling, and that person hath been cut off from the midst of his people;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> because the word of Jehovah he despised, and His command hath broken--that person is certainly cut off; his iniquity [is] on him.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And the sons of Israel are in the wilderness, and they find a man gathering wood on the sabbath-day,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> and those finding him gathering wood bring him near unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto all the company,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> and they place him in ward, for it [is] not explained what is [to be] done to him.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `The man is certainly put to death, all the company stoning him with stones, at the outside of the camp.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And all the company bring him out unto the outside of the camp, and stone him with stones, and he dieth, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, and they have made for themselves fringes on the skirts of their garments, to their generations, and they have put on the fringe of the skirt a ribbon of blue,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> and it hath been to you for a fringe, and ye have seen it, and have remembered all the commands of Jehovah, and have done them, and ye search not after your heart, and after your eyes, after which ye are going a-whoring;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> so that ye remember and have done all My commands, and ye have been holy to your God;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> I [am] Jehovah your God, who hath brought you out from the land of Egypt to become your God; I, Jehovah, [am] your God.'</p>
