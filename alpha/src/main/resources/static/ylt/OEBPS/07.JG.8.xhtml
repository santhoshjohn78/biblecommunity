<h2>Judges 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the men of Ephraim say unto him, `What [is] this thing thou hast done to us--not to call for us when thou didst go to fight with Midian?' and they strive with him severely;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and he saith unto them, `What have I done now like you? are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the harvest of Abi-Ezer?</p>

<p><a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Into your hand hath God given the heads of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what have I been able to do like you?' Then their temper desisted from off him in his speaking this thing.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Gideon cometh in unto the Jordan, passing over, he and the three hundred men who [are] with him--wearied, and pursuing,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and he saith to the men of Succoth, `Give, I pray you, cakes of bread to the people who [are] at my feet, for they [are] wearied, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna kings of Midian.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the heads of Succoth say, `Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we give to thy host bread?'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Gideon saith, `Therefore--in Jehovah's giving Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand-- I have threshed your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness, and with the threshing instruments.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he goeth up thence [to] Penuel, and speaketh unto them thus; and the men of Penuel answer him as the men of Succoth answered.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he speaketh also to the men of Penuel, saying, `In my turning back in peace, I break down this tower.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Zebah and Zalmunna [are] in Karkor, and their camps with them, about fifteen thousand, all who are left of all the camp of the sons of the east; and those falling [are] a hundred and twenty thousand men, drawing sword.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Gideon goeth up the way of those who tabernacle in tents, on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smiteth the camp, and the camp was confident;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and Zebab and Zalmunna flee, and he pursueth after them, and captureth the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and all the camp he hath caused to tremble.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Gideon son of Joash turneth back from the battle, at the going up of the sun,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and captureth a young man of the men of Succoth, and asketh him, and he describeth unto him the heads of Succoth, and its elders--seventy and seven men.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he cometh in unto the men of Succoth, and saith, `Lo Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye reproached me, saying, Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand that we give to thy men who [are] wearied bread?'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he taketh the elders of the city, and the thorns of the wilderness, and the threshing instruments, and teacheth by them the men of Succoth,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and the tower of Penuel he hath broken down, and slayeth the men of the city.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And he saith unto Zebah and unto Zalmunna, `How--the men whom ye slew in Tabor?' and they say, `As thou--so they, one--as the form of the king's sons.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And he saith, `My brethren--sons of my mother--they; Jehovah liveth, if ye had kept them alive--I had not slain you.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And he saith to Jether his first-born, `Rise, slay them;' and the young man hath not drawn his sword, for he hath been afraid, for he [is] yet a youth.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Zebah saith--also Zalmunna--`Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man--his might;' and Gideon riseth, and slayeth Zebah and Zalmunna, and taketh their round ornaments which [are] on the necks of their camels.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And the men of Israel say unto Gideon, `Rule over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, for thou hast saved us from the hand of Midian.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Gideon saith unto them, `I do not rule over you, nor doth my son rule over you; Jehovah doth rule over you.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Gideon saith unto them, `Let me ask of you a petition, and give ye to me each the ring of his prey, for they have rings of gold, for they [are] Ishmaelites.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And they say, `We certainly give;' and they spread out the garment, and cast thither each the ring of his prey;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and the weight of the rings of gold which he asked is a thousand and seven hundred [shekels] of gold, apart from the round ornaments, and the drops, and the purple garments, which [are] on the kings of Midian, and apart from the chains which [are] on the necks of their camels,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and Gideon maketh it into an ephod, and setteth it up in his city, in Ophrah, and all Israel go a-whoring after it there, and it is to Gideon and to his house for a snare.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And Midian is humbled before the sons of Israel, and have not added to lift up their head; and the land resteth forty years in the days of Gideon.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Jerubbaal son of Joash goeth and dwelleth in his own house,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and to Gideon there have been seventy sons, coming out of his loin, for he had many wives;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and his concubine, who [is] in Shechem, hath born to him--even she--a son, and he appointeth his name Abimelech.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And Gideon son of Joash dieth, in a good old age, and is buried in the burying-place of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-Ezrite.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And it cometh to pass, when Gideon [is] dead, that the sons of Israel turn back and go a-whoring after the Baalim, and set over them Baal-Berith for a god;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> and the sons of Israel have not remembered Jehovah their God, who is delivering them out of the hand of all their enemies round about,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> neither have they done kindness with the house of Jerubbaal--Gideon--according to all the good which he did with Israel.</p>
