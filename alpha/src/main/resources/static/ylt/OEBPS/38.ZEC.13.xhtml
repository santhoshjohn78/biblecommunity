<h2>Zechariah 13</h2>

<p><a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In that day there is a fountain opened To the house of David And to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, For sin and for impurity.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And it hath come to pass, in that day, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts, I cut off the names of the idols from the land, And they are not remembered any more, And also the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness I cause to pass away from the land.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And it hath been, when one prophesieth again, That said unto him have his father and his mother, his parents, `Thou dost not live, For falsehood thou hast spoken in the name of Jehovah,' And pierced him through have his father and his mother, his parents, in his prophesying.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And it hath come to pass, in that day, Ashamed are the prophets, each of his vision, in his prophesying, And they put not on a hairy robe to deceive.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And [one] hath said, `I am not a prophet, A man, a tiller of ground I am, For ground [is] my possession from my youth.'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And [one] hath said unto him, `What [are] these wounds in thy hands?' And he hath said, `Because I was smitten [at] home by my lovers.'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Sword, awake against My shepherd, And against a hero--My fellow, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts. Smite the shepherd, and scattered is the flock, And I have put back My hand on the little ones.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And it hath come to pass, In all the land, an affirmation of Jehovah, Two parts in it are cut off--they expire, And the third is left in it.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And I have brought the third into fire, And refined them like a refining of silver, And have tried them like a trying of gold, It doth call in My name, and I answer it, I have said, `My people it [is],' And it saith, `Jehovah [is] my God!'</p>
