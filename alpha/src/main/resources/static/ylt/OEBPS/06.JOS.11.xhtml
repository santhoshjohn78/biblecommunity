<h2>Joshua 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it cometh to pass when Jabin king of Hazor heareth, that he sendeth unto Jobab king of Madon, and unto the king of Shimron, and unto the king of Achshaph,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and unto the kings who [are] on the north in the hill-country, and in the plain south of Chinneroth, and in the low country, and in the elevations of Dor, on the west,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> [to] the Canaanite on the east, and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon, in the land of Mizpeh--</p>

<p><a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and they go out, they and all their camps with them, a people numerous, as the sand which [is] on the sea-shore for multitude, and horse and charioteer very many;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and all these kings are met together, and they come and encamp together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Jehovah saith unto Joshua, `Be not afraid of their presence, for to-morrow about this time I am giving all of them wounded before Israel; their horses thou dost hough, and their chariots burn with fire.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Joshua cometh, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and they fall on them;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and Jehovah giveth them into the hand of Israel, and they smite them and pursue them unto the great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-Maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward, and they smite them, till he hath not left to them a remnant;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and Joshua doth to them as Jehovah said to him; their horses he hath houghed, and their chariots burnt with fire.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Joshua turneth back at that time, and captureth Hazor, and its king he hath smitten by the sword; for Hazor formerly [is] head of all these kingdoms;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and they smite every person who [is] in it by the mouth of the sword; he hath devoted--he hath not left any one breathing, and Hazor he hath burnt with fire;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, hath Joshua captured, and he smiteth them by the mouth of the sword; he devoted them, as Moses, servant of Jehovah, commanded.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Only, all the cities which are standing by their hill, Israel hath not burned them, save Hazor only, [it] hath Joshua burnt;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, have the sons of Israel spoiled for themselves; only, every human being they have smitten by the mouth of the sword, till their destroying them; they have not left any one breathing.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> As Jehovah commanded Moses His servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so hath Joshua done; he hath not turned aside a thing of all that Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Joshua taketh all this land: the hill-country, and all the south, and all the land of Goshen, and the low country, and the plain, even the hill-country of Israel and its low lands,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> from the mount of Halak, which is going up [to] Seir, and unto Baal-Gad, in the valley of Lebanon, under mount Hermon; and all their kings he hath captured, and he smiteth them, and putteth them to death.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Many days hath Joshua made with all these kings war;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> there hath not been a city which made peace with the sons of Israel save the Hivite, inhabitants of Gibeon; the whole they have taken in battle;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> for from Jehovah it hath been to strengthen their heart, to meet in battle with Israel, in order to devote them, so that they have no grace, but in order to destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Joshua cometh at that time, and cutteth off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, even from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hillcountry of Israel; with their cities hath Joshua devoted them.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> There hath not been left Anakim in the land of the sons of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, were they left.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Joshua taketh the whole of the land, according to all that Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses, and Joshua giveth it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions, by their tribes; and the land hath rest from war.</p>
