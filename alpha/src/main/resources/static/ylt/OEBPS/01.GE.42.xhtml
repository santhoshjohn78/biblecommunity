<h2>Genesis 42</h2>

<p><a id="c42_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jacob seeth that there is corn in Egypt, and Jacob saith to his sons, `Why do you look at each other?'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> he saith also, `Lo, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt, go down thither, and buy for us from thence, and we live and do not die;'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and the ten brethren of Joseph go down to buy corn in Egypt,</p>

<p><a id="c42_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob hath not sent with his brethren, for he said, `Lest mischief meet him.'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the sons of Israel come to buy in the midst of those coming, for the famine hath been in the land of Canaan,</p>

<p><a id="c42_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and Joseph is the ruler over the land, he who is selling to all the people of the land, and Joseph's brethren come and bow themselves to him--face to the earth.</p>

<p><a id="c42_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Joseph seeth his brethren, and discerneth them, and maketh himself strange unto them, and speaketh with them sharp things, and saith unto them, `From whence have ye come?' and they say, `From the land of Canaan--to buy food.'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Joseph discerneth his brethren, but they have not discerned him,</p>

<p><a id="c42_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and Joseph remembereth the dreams which he dreamed of them, and saith unto them, `Ye [are] spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye have come.'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And they say unto him, `No, my lord, but thy servants have come to buy food;</p>

<p><a id="c42_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> we [are] all of us sons of one man, we [are] right men; thy servants have not been spies;'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and he saith unto them, `No, but the nakedness of the land ye have come to see;'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and they say, `Thy servants [are] twelve brethren; we [are] sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and lo, the young one [is] with our father to-day, and the one is not.'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Joseph saith unto them, `This [is] that which I have spoken unto you, saying, Ye [are] spies,</p>

<p><a id="c42_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> by this ye are proved: Pharaoh liveth! if ye go out from this--except by your young brother coming hither;</p>

<p><a id="c42_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and ye, remain ye bound, and let your words be proved, whether truth be with you: and if not--Pharaoh liveth! surely ye [are] spies;'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and he removeth them unto charge three days.</p>

<p><a id="c42_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Joseph saith unto them on the third day, `This do and live; God I fear!</p>

<p><a id="c42_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> if ye [are] right men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your ward, and ye, go, carry in corn [for] the famine of your houses,</p>

<p><a id="c42_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and your young brother ye bring unto me, and your words are established, and ye die not;' and they do so.</p>

<p><a id="c42_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And they say one unto another, `Verily we [are] guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul, in his making supplication unto us, and we did not hearken: therefore hath this distress come upon us.'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Reuben answereth them, saying, `Spake I not unto you, saying, Sin not against the lad? and ye hearkened not; and his blood also, lo, it is required.'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And they have not known that Joseph understandeth, for the interpreter [is] between them;</p>

<p><a id="c42_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and he turneth round from them, and weepeth, and turneth back unto them, and speaketh unto them, and taketh from them Simeon, and bindeth him before their eyes.</p>

<p><a id="c42_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Joseph commandeth, and they fill their vessels [with] corn, also to put back the money of each unto his sack, and to give to them provision for the way; and one doth to them so.</p>

<p><a id="c42_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And they lift up their corn upon their asses, and go from thence,</p>

<p><a id="c42_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and the one openeth his sack to give provender to his ass at a lodging-place, and he seeth his money, and lo, it [is] in the mouth of his bag,</p>

<p><a id="c42_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and he saith unto his brethren, `My money hath been put back, and also, lo, in my bag:' and their heart goeth out, and they tremble, one to another saying, `What [is] this God hath done to us!'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And they come in unto Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and they declare to him all the things meeting them, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c42_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> `The man, the lord of the land, hath spoken with us sharp things, and maketh us as spies of the land;</p>

<p><a id="c42_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and we say unto him, We [are] right men, we have not been spies,</p>

<p><a id="c42_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> we [are] twelve brethren, sons of our father, the one is not, and the young one [is] to-day with our father in the land of Canaan.</p>

<p><a id="c42_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> `And the man, the lord of the land, saith unto us, By this I know that ye [are] right men--one of your brethren leave with me, and [for] the famine of your houses take ye and go,</p>

<p><a id="c42_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> and bring your young brother unto me, and I know that ye [are] not spies, but ye [are] right men; your brother I give to you, and ye trade with the land.'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And it cometh to pass, they are emptying their sacks, and lo, the bundle of each man's silver [is] in his sack, and they see their bundles of silver, they and their father, and are afraid;</p>

<p><a id="c42_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> and Jacob their father saith unto them, `Me ye have bereaved; Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and Benjamin ye take--against me have been all these.'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And Reuben speaketh unto his father, saying, `My two sons thou dost put to death, if I bring him not in unto thee; give him into my hand, and I--I bring him back unto thee;'</p>

<p><a id="c42_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and he saith, `My son doth not go down with you, for his brother [is] dead, and he by himself is left; when mischief hath met him in the way in which ye go, then ye have brought down my grey hairs in sorrow to sheol.'</p>
