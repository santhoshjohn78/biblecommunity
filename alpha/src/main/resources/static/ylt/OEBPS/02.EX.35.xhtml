<h2>Exodus 35</h2>

<p><a id="c35_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Moses assembleth all the company of the sons of Israel, and saith unto them, `These [are] the things which Jehovah hath commanded--to do them:</p>

<p><a id="c35_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Six days is work done, and on the seventh day there is to you a holy [day], a sabbath of rest to Jehovah; any who doeth work in it is put to death;</p>

<p><a id="c35_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> ye do not burn a fire in any of your dwellings on the sabbath-day.'</p>

<p><a id="c35_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Moses speaketh unto all the company of the sons of Israel, saying, `This [is] the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Take ye from among you a heave-offering to Jehovah; every one whose heart [is] willing doth bring it, --the heave-offering of Jehovah, --gold, and silver, and brass,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and linen, and goats' [hair],</p>

<p><a id="c35_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and rams' skins made red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the spice perfume,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and shoham stones, and stones for settings, for an ephod, and for a breastplate.</p>

<p><a id="c35_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> `And all the wise-hearted among you come in, and make all that Jehovah hath commanded:</p>

<p><a id="c35_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> `The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its hooks, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> `The ark and its staves, the mercy-seat, and the vail of the covering,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> `The table and its staves, and all its vessels, and the bread of the presence,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> `And the candlestick for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> `And the altar of perfume, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the spice perfume, and the covering of the opening at the opening of the tabernacle,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> `The altar of burnt-offering and the brazen grate which it hath, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> `The hangings of the court, its pillars, and their sockets, and the covering of the gate of the court,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> `The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> `The coloured garments, to do service in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons to act as priest in.'</p>

<p><a id="c35_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And all the company of the sons of Israel go out from the presence of Moses,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and they come in--every man whom his heart hath lifted up, and every one whom his spirit hath made willing--they have brought in the heave-offering of Jehovah for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all its service, and for the holy garments.</p>

<p><a id="c35_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And they come in--the men with the women--every willing-hearted one--they have brought in nose-ring, and ear-ring, and seal-ring, and necklace, all golden goods, even every one who hath waved a wave-offering of gold to Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c35_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And every man with whom hath been found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and linen, and goats' [hair], and rams' skins made red, and badgers' skins, have brought [them] in;</p>

<p><a id="c35_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> every one lifting up a heave-offering of silver and brass have brought in the heaveoffering of Jehovah; and every one with whom hath been found shittim wood for any work of the service brought [it] in.</p>

<p><a id="c35_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And every wise-hearted woman hath spun with her hands, and they bring in yarn, the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the linen;</p>

<p><a id="c35_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and all the women whose heart hath lifted them up in wisdom, have spun the goats' [hair].</p>

<p><a id="c35_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And the princes have brought in the shoham stones, and the stones for settings, for the ephod, and for the breastplate,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and the spices, and the oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the spice perfume;</p>

<p><a id="c35_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> every man and woman (whom their heart hath made willing to bring in for all the work which Jehovah commanded to be done by the hand of Moses) [of] the sons of Israel brought in a willing-offering to Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c35_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Moses saith unto the sons of Israel, `See, Jehovah hath called by name Bezaleel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and He doth fill him [with] the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> even to devise devices to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> and in graving of stones for settings, and in graving of wood to work in any work of design.</p>

<p><a id="c35_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> `And to direct He hath put in his heart, he and Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan;</p>

<p><a id="c35_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> He hath filled them with wisdom of heart to do every work, of engraver, and designer, and embroiderer (in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in linen), and weaver, who do any work, and of designers of designs.</p>
