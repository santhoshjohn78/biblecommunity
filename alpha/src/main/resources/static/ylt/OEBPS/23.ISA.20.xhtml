<h2>Isaiah 20</h2>

<p><a id="c20_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In the year of the coming in of Tartan to Ashdod, when Sargon king of Asshur sendeth him, and he fighteth against Ashdod, and captureth it,</p>

<p><a id="c20_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> at that time spake Jehovah by the hand of Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, `Go, and thou hast loosed the sackcloth from off thy loins, and thy sandal thou dost draw from off thy foot,' and he doth so, going naked and barefoot.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Jehovah saith, `As My servant Isaiah hath gone naked and barefoot three years, a sign and a wonder for Egypt and for Cush,</p>

<p><a id="c20_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> so doth the king of Asshur lead the captivity of Egypt, and the removal of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, with seat uncovered--the nakedness of Egypt;</p>

<p><a id="c20_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and they have been affrighted and ashamed of Cush their confidence, and of Egypt their beauty,</p>

<p><a id="c20_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and the inhabitant of this isle hath said in that day--Lo, thus [is] our trust, Whither we have fled for help, To be delivered from the king of Asshur, And how do we escape--we?'</p>
