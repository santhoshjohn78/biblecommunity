<h2>1 Timothy 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to a command of God our Saviour, and of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> to Timotheus--genuine child in faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> according as I did exhort thee to remain in Ephesus--I going on to Macedonia--that thou mightest charge certain not to teach any other thing,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, that cause questions rather than the building up of God that is in faith: --</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> from which certain, having swerved, did turn aside to vain discourse,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> willing to be teachers of law, not understanding either the things they say, nor concerning what they asseverate,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and we have known that the law [is] good, if any one may use it lawfully;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> having known this, that for a righteous man law is not set, but for lawless and insubordinate persons, ungodly and sinners, impious and profane, parricides and matricides, menslayers,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> whoremongers, sodomites, men-stealers, liars, perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that to sound doctrine is adverse,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God, with which I was entrusted.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I give thanks to him who enabled me--Christ Jesus our Lord--that he did reckon me stedfast, having put [me] to the ministration,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> who before was speaking evil, and persecuting, and insulting, but I found kindness, because, being ignorant, I did [it] in unbelief,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and exceedingly abound did the grace of our Lord, with faith and love that [is] in Christ Jesus:</p>

<p><a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> stedfast [is] the word, and of all acceptation worthy, that Christ Jesus came to the world to save sinners--first of whom I am;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> but because of this I found kindness, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern of those about to believe on him to life age-during:</p>

<p><a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only wise God, [is] honour and glory--to the ages of the ages! Amen.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> This charge I commit to thee, child Timotheus, according to the prophesies that went before upon thee, that thou mayest war in them the good warfare,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> having faith and a good conscience, which certain having thrust away, concerning the faith did make shipwreck,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I did deliver to the Adversary, that they might be instructed not to speak evil.</p>
