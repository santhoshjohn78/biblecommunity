<h2>Leviticus 9</h2>

<p><a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it cometh to pass on the eighth day, Moses hath called for Aaron and for his sons, and for the elders of Israel,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and he saith unto Aaron, `Take to thyself a calf, a son of the herd, for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, perfect ones, and bring near before Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> `And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and a calf, and a lamb, sons of a year, perfect ones, for a burnt-offering,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and a bullock and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah, and a present mixed with oil; for to-day Jehovah hath appeared unto you.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And they take that which Moses hath commanded unto the front of the tent of meeting, and all the company draw near and stand before Jehovah;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and Moses saith, `This [is] the thing which Jehovah hath commanded; do [it], and the honour of Jehovah doth appear unto you.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Moses saith unto Aaron, `Draw near unto the altar, and make thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people, and make the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Jehovah hath commanded.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Aaron draweth near unto the altar, and slaughtereth the calf of the sin-offering, which [is] for himself;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and the sons of Aaron bring the blood near unto him, and he dippeth his finger in the blood, and putteth [it] on the horns of the altar, and the blood he hath poured out at the foundation of the altar;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and the fat, and the kidneys, and the redundance of the liver, of the sin-offering, he hath made a perfume on the altar, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and the flesh and the skin he hath burnt with fire, at the outside of the camp.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And he slaughtereth the burnt-offering, and the sons of Aaron have presented unto him the blood, and he sprinkleth it on the altar round about;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and the burnt-offering they have presented unto him, by its pieces, and the head, and he maketh perfume on the altar;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and he washeth the inwards and the legs, and maketh perfume for the burnt-offering on the altar.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he bringeth near the offering of the people, and taketh the goat of the sinoffering which [is] for the people, and slaughtered it, and maketh it a sin-offering, like the first;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and he bringeth near the burnt-offering, and maketh it, according to the ordinance;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and he bringeth near the present, and filleth his palm with it, and maketh perfume on the altar, apart from the burnt-offering of the morning.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And he slaughtereth the bullock and the ram, a sacrifice of the peace-offerings, which [are] for the people, and sons of Aaron present the blood unto him (and he sprinkleth it on the altar round about),</p>

<p><a id="c9_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and the fat of the bullock, and of the ram, the fat tail, and the covering [of the inwards], and the kidneys, and the redundance above the liver,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and they set the fat on the breasts, and he maketh perfume with the fat on the altar;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and the breasts, and the right leg hath Aaron waved--a wave-offering before Jehovah, as He hath commanded Moses.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Aaron lifteth up his hand towards the people, and blesseth them, and cometh down from making the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Moses goeth in--Aaron also--unto the tent of meeting, and they come out, and bless the people, and the honour of Jehovah appeareth unto all the people;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and fire cometh out from before Jehovah, and consumeth on the altar the burntoffering, and the fat; and all the people see, and cry aloud, and fall on their faces.</p>
