<h2>1 Timothy 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the Spirit expressly speaketh, that in latter times shall certain fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> in hypocrisy speaking lies, being seared in their own conscience,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> forbidding to marry--to abstain from meats that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those believing and acknowledging the truth,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> because every creature of God [is] good, and nothing [is] to be rejected, with thanksgiving being received,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> for it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> These things placing before the brethren, thou shalt be a good ministrant of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words of the faith, and of the good teaching, which thou didst follow after,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and the profane and old women's fables reject thou, and exercise thyself unto piety,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> for the bodily exercise is unto little profit, and the piety is to all things profitable, a promise having of the life that now is, and of that which is coming;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> stedfast [is] the word, and of all acceptation worthy;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for for this we both labour and are reproached, because we hope on the living God, who is Saviour of all men--especially of those believing.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Charge these things, and teach;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> let no one despise thy youth, but a pattern become thou of those believing in word, in behaviour, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> till I come, give heed to the reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> be not careless of the gift in thee, that was given thee through prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the eldership;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> of these things be careful; in these things be, that thy advancement may be manifest in all things;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> take heed to thyself, and to the teaching; remain in them, for this thing doing, both thyself thou shalt save, and those hearing thee.</p>
