<h2>Exodus 31</h2>

<p><a id="c31_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c31_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `See, I have called by name Bezaleel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,</p>

<p><a id="c31_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and I fill him [with] the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work,</p>

<p><a id="c31_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> to devise devices to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,</p>

<p><a id="c31_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and in graving of stone for settings, and in graving of wood to work in all work.</p>

<p><a id="c31_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> `And I, lo, I have given with him Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, and in the heart of every wise-hearted one I have given wisdom, and they have made all that which I have commanded thee.</p>

<p><a id="c31_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `The tent of meeting, and the ark of testimony, and the mercy-seat which [is] on it, and all the vessels of the tent,</p>

<p><a id="c31_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick and all its vessels, and the altar of the perfume,</p>

<p><a id="c31_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and the altar of the burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the laver and its base,</p>

<p><a id="c31_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and the coloured garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, for acting as priests in;</p>

<p><a id="c31_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and the anointing oil, and the perfume of the spices for the sanctuary; according to all that I have commanded thee--they do.'</p>

<p><a id="c31_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c31_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> `And thou, speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Only, My sabbaths ye do keep, for it [is] a sign between Me and you, to your generations, to know that I, Jehovah, am sanctifying you;</p>

<p><a id="c31_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and ye have kept the sabbath, for it [is] holy to you, he who is polluting it is certainly put to death--for any who doeth work in it--that person hath even been cut off from the midst of his people.</p>

<p><a id="c31_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> `Six days is work done, and in the seventh day [is] a sabbath of holy rest to Jehovah; any who doeth work in the sabbath-day is certainly put to death,</p>

<p><a id="c31_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and the sons of Israel have observed the sabbath; to keep the sabbath to their generations [is] a covenant age-during,</p>

<p><a id="c31_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> between Me and the sons of Israel it [is] a sign--to the age; for six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, and in the seventh day He hath ceased, and is refreshed.'</p>

<p><a id="c31_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And He giveth unto Moses, when He finisheth speaking with him in mount Sinai, two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written by the finger of God.</p>
