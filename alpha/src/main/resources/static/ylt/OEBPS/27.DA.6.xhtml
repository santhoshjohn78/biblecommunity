<h2>Daniel 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> It hath been good before Darius, and he hath established over the kingdom satraps--a hundred and twenty--that they may be throughout the whole kingdom,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and higher than they three presidents, of whom Daniel [is] first, that these satraps may give to them an account, and the king have no loss.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Then this Daniel hath been overseer over the presidents and satraps, because that an excellent spirit [is] in him, and the king hath thought to establish him over the whole kingdom.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then the presidents and satraps have been seeking to find a cause of complaint against</p>

<p><a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Then these men are saying, `We do not find against this Daniel any cause of complaint, except we have found [it] against him in the law of his God.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Then these presidents and satraps have assembled near the king, and thus they are saying to him: `O king Darius, to the ages live!</p>

<p><a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Taken counsel have all the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects, and the satraps, the counsellors, and the governors, to establish a royal statute, and to strengthen an interdict, that any who seeketh a petition from any god and man until thirty days, save of thee, O king, is cast into a den of lions.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Now, O king, thou dost establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it is not to be changed, as a law of Media and Persia, that doth not pass away.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Therefore king Darius hath signed the writing and interdict.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Daniel, when he hath known that the writing is signed, hath gone up to his house, and the window being opened for him, in his upper chamber, over-against Jerusalem, three times in a day he is kneeling on his knees, and praying, and confessing before his God, because that he was doing [it] before this.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Then these men have assembled, and found Daniel praying and entreating grace before his God;</p>

<p><a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> then they have come near, yea, they are saying before the king concerning the king's interdict: `Hast thou not signed an interdict, that any man who seeketh from any god and man until thirty days, save of thee, O king, is cast into a den of lions?' Answered hath the king, and said, `The thing [is] certain as a law of Media and Persia, that doth not pass away.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Then they have answered, yea, they are saying before the king, that, `Daniel, who [is] of the sons of the Removed of Judah, hath not placed on thee, O king, [any] regard, nor on the interdict that thou hast signed, and three times in a day heis seeking his petition.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Then the king, when he hath heard the matter, is greatly displeased at himself, and on</p>

<p><a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Then these men have assembled near the king, and are saying to the king, `know, O king, that the law of Media and Persia [is]: That any interdict and statute that the king doth establish is not to be changed.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Then the king hath said, and they have brought Daniel, and have cast [him] into a den of lions. The king hath answered and said to Daniel, `Thy God, whom thou art serving continually, Himself doth deliver thee.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And a stone hath been brought and placed at the mouth of the den, and the king hath sealed it with his signet, and with the signet of his great men, that the purpose be not changed concerning Daniel.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Then hath the king gone to his palace, and he hath passed the night fasting, and dahavan have not been brought up before him, and his sleep hath fled [from] off him.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Then doth the king rise in the early morning, at the light, and in haste to the den of lions he hath gone;</p>

<p><a id="c6_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and at his coming near to the den, to Daniel, with a grieved voice, he crieth. The king hath answered and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, thy God, whom thou art serving continually, is He able to deliver thee from the lions?'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Then Daniel hath spoken with the king: `O king, to the ages live:</p>

<p><a id="c6_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> my God hath sent His messenger, and hath shut the lions' mouths, and they have not injured me: because that before Him purity hath been found in me; and also before thee, O king, injury I have not done.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Then was the king very glad for him, and he hath commanded Daniel to be taken up out of the den, and Daniel hath been taken up out of the den, and no injury hath been found in him, because he hath believed in his God.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And the king hath said, and they have brought those men who had accused Daniel, and to the den of lions they have cast them, they, their sons, and their wives; and they have not come to the lower part of the den till that the lions have powerover them, and all their bones they have broken small.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Then Darius the king hath written to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who are dwelling in all the land: `Your peace be great!</p>

<p><a id="c6_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> From before me is made a decree, that in every dominion of my kingdom they are trembling and fearing before the God of Daniel, for He [is] the living God, and abiding to the ages, and His kingdom that which [is] not destroyed, and His dominion [is] unto the end.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> A deliverer, and rescuer, and doer of signs and wonders in the heavens and in earth [is] He who hath delivered Daniel from the paw of the lions.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And this Daniel hath prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</p>
