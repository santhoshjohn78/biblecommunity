<h2>Psalms 93</h2>

<p><a id="c93_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah hath reigned, Excellency He hath put on, Jehovah put on strength, He girded Himself, Also--established is the world, unmoved.</p>

<p><a id="c93_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Established is Thy throne since then, From the age Thou [art].</p>

<p><a id="c93_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, Floods have lifted up their voice, Floods lift up their breakers.</p>

<p><a id="c93_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Than the voices of many mighty waters, Breakers of a sea, mighty on high [is] Jehovah,</p>

<p><a id="c93_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thy testimonies have been very stedfast, To Thy house comely [is] holiness, O Jehovah, for length of days!</p>
