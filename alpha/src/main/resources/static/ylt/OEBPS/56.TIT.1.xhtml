<h2>Titus 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the choice ones of God, and an acknowledging of truth that [is] according to piety,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> upon hope of life age-during, which God, who doth not lie, did promise before times of ages,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> (and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Saviour,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> to Titus--true child according to a common faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour!</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For this cause left I thee in Crete, that the things lacking thou mayest arrange, and mayest set down in every city elders, as I did appoint to thee;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having children stedfast, not under accusation of riotous living or insubordinate--</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> for it behoveth the overseer to be blameless, as God's steward, not self-pleased, nor irascible, not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded, righteous, kind, selfcontrolled,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> holding--according to the teaching--to the stedfast word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching, and the gainsayers to convict;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers--especially they of the circumcision--</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> whose mouth it behoveth to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what things it behoveth not, for filthy lucre's sake.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said--`Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> all things, indeed, [are] pure to the pure, and to the defiled and unstedfast [is] nothing pure, but of them defiled [are] even the mind and the conscience;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> God they profess to know, and in the works they deny [Him], being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work disapproved.</p>
