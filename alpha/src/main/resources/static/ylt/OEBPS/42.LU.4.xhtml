<h2>Luke 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, turned back from the Jordan, and was brought in the Spirit to the wilderness,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> forty days being tempted by the Devil, and he did not eat anything in those days, and they having been ended, he afterward hungered,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and the Devil said to him, `If Son thou art of God, speak to this stone that it may become bread.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Jesus answered him, saying, `It hath been written, that, not on bread only shall man live, but on every saying of God.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the Devil having brought him up to an high mountain, shewed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and the Devil said to him, `To thee I will give all this authority, and their glory, because to me it hath been delivered, and to whomsoever I will, I do give it;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> thou, then, if thou mayest bow before me--all shall be thine.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Jesus answering him said, `Get thee behind me, Adversary, for it hath been written, Thou shalt bow before the Lord thy God, and Him only thou shalt serve.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, `If the Son thou art of God, cast thyself down hence,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for it hath been written--To His messengers He will give charge concerning thee, to guard over thee,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and--On hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou mayest dash against a stone thy foot.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Jesus answering said to him--`It hath been said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And having ended all temptation, the Devil departed from him till a convenient season.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Jesus turned back in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and a fame went forth through all the region round about concerning him,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and he was teaching in their synagogues, being glorified by all.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he came to Nazareth, where he hath been brought up, and he went in, according to his custom, on the sabbath-day, to the synagogue, and stood up to read;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and there was given over to him a roll of Isaiah the prophet, and having unfolded the roll, he found the place where it hath been written:</p>

<p><a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> `The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon me, Because He did anoint me; To proclaim good news to the poor, Sent me to heal the broken of heart, To proclaim to captives deliverance, And to blind receiving of sight, To send away the bruised with deliverance,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And having folded the roll, having given [it] back to the officer, he sat down, and the eyes of all in the synagogue were gazing on him.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And he began to say unto them--`To-day hath this writing been fulfilled in your ears;'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and all were bearing testimony to him, and were wondering at the gracious words that are coming forth out of his mouth, and they said, `Is not this the son of Joseph?'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And he said unto them, `Certainly ye will say to me this simile, Physician, heal thyself; as great things as we heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country;'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and he said, `Verily I say to you--No prophet is accepted in his own country;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and of a truth I say to you, Many widows were in the days of Elijah, in Israel, when the heaven was shut for three years and six months, when great famine came on all the land,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and unto none of them was Elijah sent, but--to Sarepta of Sidon, unto a woman, a widow;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and many lepers were in the time of Elisha the prophet, in Israel, and none of them was cleansed, but--Naaman the Syrian.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And all in the synagogue were filled with wrath, hearing these things,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and having risen, they put him forth without the city, and brought him unto the brow of the hill on which their city had been built--to cast him down headlong,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and he, having gone through the midst of them, went away.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the sabbaths,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and they were astonished at his teaching, because his word was with authority.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And in the synagogue was a man, having a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a great voice,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> saying, `Away, what--to us and to thee, Jesus, O Nazarene? thou didst come to destroy us; I have known thee who thou art--the Holy One of God.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And Jesus did rebuke him, saying, `Be silenced, and come forth out of him;' and the demon having cast him into the midst, came forth from him, having hurt him nought;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> and amazement came upon all, and they were speaking together, with one another, saying, `What [is] this word, that with authority and power he doth command the unclean spirits, and they come forth?'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> and there was going forth a fame concerning him to every place of the region round about.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And having risen out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon, and the mother-in-law of Simon was pressed with a great fever, and they did ask him about her,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> and having stood over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her, and presently, having risen, she was ministering to them.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And at the setting of the sun, all, as many as had any ailing with manifold sicknesses, brought them unto him, and he on each one of them [his] hands having put, did heal them.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And demons also were coming forth from many, crying out and saying--`Thou art the Christ, the Son of God;' and rebuking, he did not suffer them to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> And day having come, having gone forth, he went on to a desert place, and the multitudes were seeking him, and they came unto him, and were staying him--not to go on from them,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> and he said unto them--`Also to the other cities it behoveth me to proclaim good news of the reign of God, because for this I have been sent;'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> and he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.</p>
