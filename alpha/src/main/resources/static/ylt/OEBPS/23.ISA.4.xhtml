<h2>Isaiah 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And taken hold have seven women on one man, In that day, saying, `Our own bread we do eat, And our own raiment we put on, Only, let thy name be called over us, Remove thou our reproach.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> In that day is the Shoot of Jehovah for desire and for honour, And the fruit of the earth For excellence and for beauty to the escaped of Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And it hath been, he who is left in Zion, And he who is remaining in Jerusalem, `Holy' is said of him, Of every one who is written for life in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> If the Lord hath washed away The filth of daughters of Zion, And the blood of Jerusalem purgeth from her midst, By the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Then hath Jehovah prepared Over every fixed place of Mount Zion, And over her convocations, A cloud by day, and smoke, And the shining of a flaming fire by night, That, over all honour a safe-guard,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And a covering may be, For a shadow by day from drought, And for a refuge, and for a hiding place, From inundation and from rain!</p>
