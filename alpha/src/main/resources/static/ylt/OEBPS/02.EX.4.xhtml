<h2>Exodus 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Moses answereth and saith, `And, if they do not give credence to me, nor hearken to my voice, and say, Jehovah hath not appeared unto thee?'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Jehovah saith unto him, `What [is] this in thy hand?' and he saith, `A rod;'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and He saith, `Cast it to the earth;' and he casteth it to the earth, and it becometh a serpent--and Moses fleeth from its presence.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Put forth thy hand, and lay hold on the tail of it;' and he putteth forth his hand, and layeth hold on it, and it becometh a rod in his hand--</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> `--so that they believe that Jehovah, God of their fathers, hath appeared unto thee, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Jehovah saith to him again, `Put in, I pray thee, thy hand into thy bosom;' and he putteth in his hand into his bosom, and he bringeth it out, and lo, his hand [is] leprous as snow;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and He saith, `Put back thy hand unto thy bosom;' and he putteth back his hand unto his bosom, and he bringeth it out from his bosom, and lo, it hath turned back as his flesh--</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> `--and it hath come to pass, if they do not give credence to thee, and hearken not to the voice of the first sign, that they have given credence to the voice of the latter sign.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> `And it hath come to pass, if they do not give credence even to these two signs, nor hearken to thy voice, that thou hast taken of the waters of the River, and hast poured on the dry land, and the waters which thou takest from the River have been, yea, they have become--blood on the dry land.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Moses saith unto Jehovah, `O, my Lord, I [am] not a man of words, either yesterday, or before, or since Thy speaking unto Thy servant, for I [am] slow of mouth, and slow of tongue.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Jehovah saith unto him, `Who appointed a mouth for man? or who appointeth the dumb, or deaf, or open, or blind? is it not I, Jehovah?</p>

<p><a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and now, go, and I--I am with thy mouth, and have directed thee that which thou speakest;'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and he saith, `O, my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand Thou dost send.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Moses, and He saith, `Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I have known that he speaketh well, and also, lo, he is coming out to meet thee; when he hath seen thee, then he hath rejoiced in his heart,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and thou hast spoken unto him, and hast set the words in his mouth, and I--I am with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and have directed you that which ye do;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and he, he hath spoken for thee unto the people, and it hath come to pass, he--he is to thee for a mouth, and thou--thou art to him for God;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and this rod thou dost take in thy hand, with which thou doest the signs.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Moses goeth and turneth back unto Jethro his father-in-law, and saith to him, `Let me go, I pray thee, and I turn back unto my brethren who [are] in Egypt, and I see whether they are yet alive.' And Jethro saith to Moses, `Go in peace.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And Jehovah saith unto Moses in Midian, `Go, turn back to Egypt, for all the men have died who seek thy life;'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and Moses taketh his wife, and his sons, and causeth them to ride on the ass, and turneth back to the land of Egypt, and Moses taketh the rod of God in his hand.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `In thy going to turn back to Egypt, see--all the wonders which I have put in thy hand--that thou hast done them before Pharaoh, and I--I strengthen his heart, and he doth not send the people away;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and thou hast said unto Pharaoh, Thus said Jehovah, My son, My first-born [is] Israel,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and I say unto thee, Send away My son, and he doth serve Me; and--thou dost refuse to send him away--lo, I am slaying thy son, thy first-born.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And it cometh to pass in the way, in a lodging place, that Jehovah meeteth him, and seeketh to put him to death;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and Zipporah taketh a flint, and cutteth off the foreskin of her son, and causeth [it] to touch his feet, and saith, `Surely a bridegroom of blood [art] thou to me;'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and He desisteth from him: then she said, `A bridegroom of blood,' in reference to the circumcision.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And Jehovah saith unto Aaron, `Go to meet Moses into the wilderness;' and he goeth, and meeteth him in the mount of God, and kisseth him,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and Moses declareth to Aaron all the words of Jehovah with which He hath sent him, and all the signs with which He hath charged him.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Moses goeth--Aaron also--and they gather all the elders of the sons of Israel,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and Aaron speaketh all the words which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses, and doth the signs before the eyes of the people;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and the people believe when they hear that Jehovah hath looked after the sons of Israel, and that He hath seen their affliction; and they bow and do obeisance.</p>
