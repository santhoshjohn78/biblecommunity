<h2>Mark 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And he began to speak to them in similes: `A man planted a vineyard, and put a hedge around, and digged an under-wine-vat, and built a tower, and gave it out to husbandmen, and went abroad;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and he sent unto the husbandmen at the due time a servant, that from the husbandmen he may receive from the fruit of the vineyard,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and they, having taken him, did severely beat [him], and did send him away empty.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> `And again he sent unto them another servant, and at that one having cast stones, they wounded [him] in the head, and sent away--dishonoured.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> `And again he sent another, and that one they killed; and many others, some beating, and some killing.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> `Having yet therefore one son--his beloved--he sent also him unto them last, saying-- They will reverence my son;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and those husbandmen said among themselves--This is the heir, come, we may kill him, and ours shall be the inheritance;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and having taken him, they did kill, and cast [him] forth without the vineyard.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> `What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And this Writing did ye not read: A stone that the builders rejected, it did become the head of a corner:</p>

<p><a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> from the Lord was this, and it is wonderful in our eyes.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And they were seeking to lay hold on him, and they feared the multitude, for they knew that against them he spake the simile, and having left him, they went away;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they may ensnare him in discourse,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and they having come, say to him, `Teacher, we have known that thou art true, and thou art not caring for any one, for thou dost not look to the face of men, but in truth the way of God dost teach; is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not? may we give, or may we not give?'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, `Why me do ye tempt? bring me a denary, that I may see;'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and they brought, and he saith to them, `Whose [is] this image, and the inscription?' and they said to him, `Caesar's;'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and Jesus answering said to them, `Give back the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God;' and they did wonder at him.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the Sadducees come unto him, who say there is not a rising again, and they questioned him, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> `Teacher, Moses wrote to us, that if any one's brother may die, and may leave a wife, and may leave no children, that his brother may take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> `There were then seven brothers, and the first took a wife, and dying, he left no seed;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and the second took her, and died, neither left he seed, and the third in like manner,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and the seven took her, and left no seed, last of all died also the woman;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> in the rising again, then, whenever they may rise, of which of them shall she be wife-- for the seven had her as wife?'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Jesus answering said to them, `Do ye not because of this go astray, not knowing the Writings, nor the power of God?</p>

<p><a id="c12_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> for when they may rise out of the dead, they neither marry nor are they given in marriage, but are as messengers who are in the heavens.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> `And concerning the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the Book of Moses (at The Bush), how God spake to him, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> he is not the God of dead men, but a God of living men; ye then go greatly astray.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And one of the scribes having come near, having heard them disputing, knowing that he answered them well, questioned him, `Which is the first command of all?'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and Jesus answered him--`The first of all the commands [is], Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and thou shalt love the Lord thy God out of all thy heart, and out of thy soul, and out of all thine understanding, and out of all thy strength--this [is] the first command;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and the second [is] like [it], this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; --greater than these there is no other command.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And the scribe said to him, `Well, Teacher, in truth thou hast spoken that there is one God, and there is none other but He;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> and to love Him out of all the heart, and out of all the understanding, and out of all the soul, and out of all the strength, and to love one's neighbour as one's self, is more than all the whole burnt-offerings and the sacrifices.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And Jesus, having seen him that he answered with understanding, said to him, `Thou art not far from the reign of God;' and no one any more durst question him.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And Jesus answering said, teaching in the temple, `How say the scribes that the Christ is son of David?</p>

<p><a id="c12_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> for David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my lord, Sit thou on My right hand, till I place thine enemies--thy footstool;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> therefore David himself saith of him Lord, and whence is he his son?' And the great multitude were hearing him gladly,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and he was saying to them in his teaching, `Beware of the scribes, who will in long robes to walk, and love salutations in the market-places,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> and first seats in the synagogues, and first couches in suppers,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> who are devouring the widows' houses, and for a pretence are making long prayers; these shall receive more abundant judgment.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And Jesus having sat down over-against the treasury, was beholding how the multitude do put brass into the treasury, and many rich were putting in much,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> and having come, a poor widow did put in two mites, which are a farthing.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> And having called near his disciples, he saith to them, `Verily I say to you, that this poor widow hath put in more than all those putting into the treasury;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> for all, out of their abundance, put in, but she, out of her want, all that she had put in-- all her living.'</p>
