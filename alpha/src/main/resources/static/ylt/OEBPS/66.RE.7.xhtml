<h2>Revelation 7</h2>

<p><a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And after these things I saw four messengers, standing upon the four corners of the land, holding the four winds of the land, that the wind may not blow upon the land, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree;</p>

<p><a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and I saw another messenger going up from the rising of the sun, having a seal of the living God, and he did cry with a great voice to the four messengers, to whom it was given to injure the land and the sea, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> `Do not injure the land, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we may seal the servants of our God upon their foreheads.'</p>

<p><a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And I heard the number of those sealed, (one hundred and forty four thousands were sealed out of all the tribes of the sons of Israel):</p>

<p><a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand were sealed;</p>

<p><a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand were sealed;</p>

<p><a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand were sealed;</p>

<p><a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> After these things I saw, and lo, a great multitude, which to number no one was able, out of all nations, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and crying with a great voice, saying, `The salvation [is] to Him who is sitting upon the throne--to our God, and to the Lamb!'</p>

<p><a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And all the messengers stood around the throne, and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell upon their face, and bowed before God,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> saying, `Amen! the blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and the honour, and the power, and the strength, [are] to our God--to the ages of the ages! Amen!'</p>

<p><a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And answer did one of the elders, saying to me, `These, who have been arrayed with the white robes--who are they, and whence came they?'</p>

<p><a id="c7_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and I have said to him, `Sir, thou hast known;' and he said to me, `These are those who are coming out of the great tribulation, and they did wash their robes, and they made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb;</p>

<p><a id="c7_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> because of this are they before the throne of God, and they do service to Him day and night in His sanctuary, and He who is sitting upon the throne shall tabernacle over them;</p>

<p><a id="c7_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> they shall not hunger any more, nor may the sun fall upon them, nor any heat,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> because the Lamb that [is] in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters, and wipe away shall God every tear from their eyes.'</p>
