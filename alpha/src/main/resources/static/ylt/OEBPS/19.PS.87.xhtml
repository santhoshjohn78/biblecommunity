<h2>Psalms 87</h2>

<p><a id="c87_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> By sons of Korah. --A Psalm, a song. His foundation [is] in holy mountains.</p>

<p><a id="c87_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah is loving the gates of Zion Above all the tabernacles of Jacob.</p>

<p><a id="c87_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Honourable things are spoken in Thee, O city of God. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c87_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I mention Rahab and Babel to those knowing Me, Lo, Philistia, and Tyre, with Cush! This [one] was born there.</p>

<p><a id="c87_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And of Zion it is said: Each one was born in her, And He, the Most High, doth establish her.</p>

<p><a id="c87_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Jehovah doth recount in the describing of the peoples, `This [one] was born there.' Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c87_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Singers also as players on instruments, All my fountains [are] in Thee!</p>
