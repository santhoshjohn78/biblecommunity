<h2>Joshua 22</h2>

<p><a id="c22_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then Joshua calleth for the Reubenite, and for the Gadite, and for the half of the tribe of Manasseh,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and saith unto them, `Ye--ye have kept the whole of that which Moses, servant of Jehovah, commanded you, and ye hearken to my voice, to all that I have commanded you;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, and have kept the charge--the command of Jehovah your God.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> `And, now, Jehovah your God hath given rest to your brethren, as He spake to them; and now, turn ye, and go for yourselves to your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses, servant of Jehovah, hath given to you beyond the Jordan.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Only, be very watchful to do the command and the law which Moses, servant of Jehovah, commanded you, to love Jehovah your God, and to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commands, and to cleave to Him, and to serve Him, with all your heart,and with all your soul.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Joshua blesseth them, and sendeth them away, and they go unto their tents.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And to the half of the tribe of Manasseh hath Moses given, in Bashan, and to its [other] half hath Joshua given with their brethren beyond the Jordan westward; and also when</p>

<p><a id="c22_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and speak unto them, saying, `With great riches turn ye back unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, turn back and go from the sons of Israel out of Shiloh, which [is] in the land of Canaan, to go unto the land of Gilead, unto the land of their possession, inwhich they have possession, according to the command of Jehovah, by the hand of Moses;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and they come in unto the districts of the Jordan, which [are] in the land of Canaan, and the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, build there an altar by the Jordan--a great altar for appearance.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the sons of Israel hear, saying, `Lo, the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, have built the altar over-against the land of Canaan, on the districts of the Jordan, at the passage of the sons of Israel.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the sons of Israel hear, and all the company of the sons of Israel is assembled at Shiloh, to go up against them to war;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and the sons of Israel send unto the sons of Reuben, and unto the sons of Gad, and unto the half of the tribe of Manasseh--unto the land of Gilead--Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and ten princes with him, one prince, one prince, for a house of a father, for all the tribes of Israel, and each of them a head of a house of their fathers, for the thousands of Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And they come in unto the sons of Reuben, and unto the sons of Gad, and unto the half of the tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and speak with them, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> `Thus said all the company of Jehovah, What [is] this trespass which ye have trespassed against the God of Israel, to turn back to-day from after Jehovah, by your building for you an altar, for your rebelling to-day against Jehovah?</p>

<p><a id="c22_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Is the iniquity of Peor little to us, from which we have not been cleansed till this day- -and the plague is in the company of Jehovah,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> that ye turn back to-day from after Jehovah? and it hath been--ye rebel to-day against Jehovah--and to-morrow against all the company of Israel He is wroth.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> `And surely, if the land of your possession is unclean, pass over for you unto the land of the possession of Jehovah, where the tabernacle of Jehovah hath tabernacled, and have possession in our midst; and against Jehovah rebel not, and against us rebel not, by your building for you an altar, besides the altar of Jehovah our God.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Did not Achan son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and on all the company of Israel there was wrath? and he alone expired not in his iniquity.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, answer and speak with the heads of the thousands of Israel:</p>

<p><a id="c22_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> `The God of gods--Jehovah, the God of gods--Jehovah, He is knowing, and Israel, he doth know, if in rebellion, and if in trespass against Jehovah (Thou dost not save us this day!)</p>

<p><a id="c22_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> [we are] building for ourselves an altar to turn back from after Jehovah, and if to cause to go up on it burnt-offering and present, and if to make on it peace-offerings--Jehovah Himself doth require [it].</p>

<p><a id="c22_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> `And if not, from fear of [this] thing we have done it, saying, Hereafter your sons do speak to ours sons, saying, What to you and to Jehovah God of Israel?</p>

<p><a id="c22_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> for a border hath Jehovah put between us and you, O sons of Reuben, and sons of Gad--Jordan; ye have no portion in Jehovah--and your sons have caused our sons to cease, not to fear Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> `And we say, Pray let us prepare for ourselves to build the altar--not for burntoffering nor for sacrifice--</p>

<p><a id="c22_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> but a witness it [is] between us and you, and between our generations after us, to do the service of Jehovah before Him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings, and your sons do not say hereafter to our sons, Ye have no portion in Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> `And we say, And it hath been, when they say [so] unto us, and unto our generations hereafter, that we have said, See the pattern of the altar of Jehovah, which our fathers made--not for burnt-offering nor for sacrifice--but a witness it [is] between us and you.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> `Far be it from us to rebel against Jehovah, and to turn back to-day from after Jehovah, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for present, and for sacrifice, apart from the altar of Jehovah our God, which [is] before His tabernacle.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the company, and the heads of the thousands of Israel, who [are] with him, hear the words which the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the sons of Manasseh have spoken, and it is good in their eyes.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest saith unto the sons of Reuben, and unto the sons of Gad, and unto the sons of Manasseh, `To-day we have known that Jehovah [is] in our midst, because ye have not committed against Jehovah this trespass--then ye have delivered the sons of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, turn back from the sons of Reuben, and from the sons of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, unto the sons of Israel, and bring them back word;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> and the thing is good in the eyes of the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel bless God, and have not said to go up against them to war, to destroy the land which the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, are dwelling in.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad proclaim concerning the altar, that `it [is] a witness between us that Jehovah [is] God.'</p>
