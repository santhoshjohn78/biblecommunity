<h2>Exodus 37</h2>

<p><a id="c37_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Bezaleel maketh the ark of shittim wood, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and he overlayeth it with pure gold within and without, and maketh for it a wreath of gold round about;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and he casteth for it four rings of gold, on its four feet, even two rings on its one side, and two rings on its second side;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and he maketh staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold,</p>

<p><a id="c37_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and he bringeth in the staves into the rings, by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he maketh a mercy-seat of pure gold, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and he maketh two cherubs of gold, of beaten work he hath made them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> one cherub at the end on this [side], and one cherub at the end on that, out of the mercy-seat he hath made the cherubs, at its two ends;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and the cherubs are spreading out wings on high, covering over the mercy-seat with their wings, and their faces [are] one towards another; towards the mercy-seat have the faces of the cherubs been.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he maketh the table of shittim wood; two cubits its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height,</p>

<p><a id="c37_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and overlayeth it with pure gold, and maketh for it a wreath of gold round about.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And he maketh for it a border of a handbreadth round about, and maketh a wreath of gold for its border round about;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and he casteth for it four rings of gold, and putteth the rings on the four corners which [are] to its four feet;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> over-against the border have the rings been, places for staves to bear the table.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he maketh the staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold, to bear the table;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and he maketh the vessels which [are] upon the table, its dishes, and its bowls, and its cups, and the cups by which they pour out, of pure gold.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And he maketh the candlestick of pure gold; of beaten work he hath made the candlestick, its base, and its branch, its calyxes, its knops, and its flowers, have been of the same;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and six branches are coming out of its sides, three branches of the candlestick out of its one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of its second side;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> three calyxes, made like almonds, in the one branch, a knop and a flower; and three calyxes, made like almonds, in another branch, a knop and a flower; so to the six branches which are coming out of the candlestick.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And in the candlestick [are] four calyxes, made like almonds, its knops, and its flowers,</p>

<p><a id="c37_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and a knop under the two branches of the same, and a knop under the two branches of the same, and a knop under the two branches of the same, [are] to the six branches which are coming out of it;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> their knops and their branches have been of the same; all of it one beaten work of pure gold.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And he maketh its seven lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff-dishes, of pure gold;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> of a talent of pure gold he hath made it, and all its vessels.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And he maketh the perfume-altar of shittim wood; a cubit its length, and a cubit its breadth (square), and two cubits its height; its horns have been of the same;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and he overlayeth it with pure gold, its top and its sides round about, and its horns; and he maketh for it a wreath of gold round about;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and two rings of gold he hath made for it under its wreath, at its two corners, at its two sides, for places for staves to bear it with them.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And he maketh the staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and he maketh the holy anointing oil, and the pure spice-perfume--work of a compounder.</p>
