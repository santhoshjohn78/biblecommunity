<h2>Psalms 53</h2>

<p><a id="c53_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To the Overseer. --`On a disease.' --An instruction, by David. A fool said in his heart, `There is no God.' They have done corruptly, Yea, they have done abominable iniquity, There is none doing good.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> God from the heavens looked on the sons of men, To see if there be an understanding one, [One] seeking God.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Every one went back, together they became filthy, There is none doing good--not even one.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Have not workers of iniquity known, Those eating my people have eaten bread, God they have not called.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> There they feared a fear--there was no fear, For God hath scattered the bones of him Who is encamping against thee, Thou hast put to shame, For God hath despised them.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Who doth give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When God turneth back [to] a captivity of His people, Jacob doth rejoice--Israel is glad!</p>
