<h2>Jeremiah 29</h2>

<p><a id="c29_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And these [are] words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the remnant of the elders of the removal, and unto the priests, and unto the prophets, and unto all the people--whom Nebuchadnezzar removed from Jerusalem to Babylon,</p>

<p><a id="c29_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> After the going forth of Jeconiah the king, and the mistress, and the officers, heads of Judah and Jerusalem, and the artificer, and the smith, from Jerusalem--</p>

<p><a id="c29_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> By the hand of Eleasah son of Shaphan, and Gemariah son of Hilkijah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon--to Babylon, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c29_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> `Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, to all the removal that I removed from Jerusalem to Babylon,</p>

<p><a id="c29_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Build ye houses, and abide; and plant ye gardens, and eat their fruit;</p>

<p><a id="c29_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take for your sons wives, and your daughters give to husbands, and they bear sons and daughters; and multiply there, and ye are not few;</p>

<p><a id="c29_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And seek the peace of the city whither I have removed you, and pray for it unto Jehovah, for in its peace ye have peace.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> `For thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Let not your prophets who [are] in your midst, and your diviners, lift you up, nor hearken ye unto their dreams, that ye are causing [them] to dream;</p>

<p><a id="c29_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For with falsehood they are prophesying to you in My name; I have not sent them, an affirmation of Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> `For thus said Jehovah, Surely at the fulness of Babylon--seventy years--I inspect you, and have established towards you My good word, to bring you back unto this place.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For I have known the thoughts that I am thinking towards you--an affirmation of Jehovah; thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give to you posterity and hope.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> `And ye have called Me, and have gone, and have prayed unto Me, and I have hearkened unto you,</p>

<p><a id="c29_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And ye have sought Me, and have found, for ye seek Me with all your heart;</p>

<p><a id="c29_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And I have been found of you--an affirmation of Jehovah; and I have turned back [to] your captivity, and have gathered you out of all the nations, and out of all the places whither I have driven you--an affirmation of Jehovah--and I have brought you back unto the place whence I removed you.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> `Because ye have said, Jehovah hath raised up to us prophets in Babylon,</p>

<p><a id="c29_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Surely thus said Jehovah concerning the king who is sitting on the throne of David, and concerning all the people that is dwelling in this city, your brethren who went not forth with you in the removal;</p>

<p><a id="c29_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, Lo, I am sending among them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and I have given them up as figs that [are] vile, that are not eaten for badness.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And I have pursued after them with sword, with famine, and with pestilence, and have given them for a trembling to all kingdoms of the earth, for a curse and for an astonishment, and for a hissing, and for a reproach among all the nations whither I have driven them,</p>

<p><a id="c29_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Because that they have not hearkened unto My words--an affirmation of Jehovah-- that I sent unto them by My servants the prophets, rising early and sending, and ye hearkened not-- an affirmation of Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> `And ye, hear ye a word of Jehovah, all ye of the captivity that I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon,</p>

<p><a id="c29_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, concerning Ahab son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you in My name falsehood: Lo, I am giving them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he hath smitten them before your eyes,</p>

<p><a id="c29_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And taken from them hath been a reviling by all the removed of Judah that [are] in Babylon, saying, Jehovah doth set thee as Zedekiah, and as Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted with fire;</p>

<p><a id="c29_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Because that they have done folly in Israel, and commit adultery with the wives of their neighbours, and speak a word in My name falsely that I have not commanded them, and I [am] He who knoweth and a witness--an affirmation of Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> `And unto Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou dost speak, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c29_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, saying, Because that thou hast sent in thy name letters unto all the people who [are] in Jerusalem, and unto Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, and unto all the priests, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c29_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Jehovah hath made thee priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, for there being inspectors of the house of Jehovah, for every one mad and making himself a prophet, and thou hast put him unto the torture and unto the stocks.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And now, why hast thou not pushed against Jeremiah of Anathoth, who is making himself a prophet to you?</p>

<p><a id="c29_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Because that he hath sent unto us to Babylon, saying, It [is] long, build ye houses, and abide; and plant ye gardens, and eat their fruit.'</p>

<p><a id="c29_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Zephaniah the priest readeth this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c29_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> `Send unto all the removal, saying, Thus said Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite, Because that Shemaiah prophesied to you, and I--I have not sent him, and he doth cause you to trust on falsehood,</p>

<p><a id="c29_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> Therefore, thus said Jehovah, Lo, I am seeing after Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and after his seed, he hath none dwelling in the midst of this people, nor doth he look on the good that I am doing to My people--an affirmation of Jehovah--for apostasy he hath spoken against Jehovah.'</p>
