<h2>Genesis 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Abram is a son of ninety and nine years, and Jehovah appeareth unto Abram, and saith unto him, `I [am] God Almighty, walk habitually before Me, and be thou perfect;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and I give My covenant between Me and thee, and multiply thee very exceedingly.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Abram falleth upon his face, and God speaketh with him, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> `I--lo, My covenant [is] with thee, and thou hast become father of a multitude of nations;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and thy name is no more called Abram, but thy name hath been Abraham, for father of a multitude of nations have I made thee;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and I have made thee exceeding fruitful, and made thee become nations, and kings go out from thee.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `And I have established My covenant between Me and thee, and thy seed after thee, to their generations, for a covenant age-during, to become God to thee, and to thy seed after thee;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and I have given to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, the whole land of Canaan, for a possession age-during, and I have become their God.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And God saith unto Abraham, `And thou dost keep My covenant, thou and thy seed after thee, to their generations;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> this [is] My covenant which ye keep between Me and you, and thy seed after thee: Every male of you [is] to be circumcised;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and ye have circumcised the flesh of your foreskin, and it hath become a token of a covenant between Me and you.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> `And a son of eight days is circumcised by you; every male to your generations, born in the house, or bought with money from any son of a stranger, who is not of thy seed;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> he is certainly circumcised who [is] born in thine house, or bought with thy money; and My covenant hath become in your flesh a covenant age-during;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and an uncircumcised one, a male, the flesh of whose foreskin is not circumcised, even that person hath been cut off from his people; My covenant he hath broken.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And God saith unto Abraham, `Sarai thy wife--thou dost not call her name Sarai, for Sarah [is] her name;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and I have blessed her, and have also given to thee a son from her; and I have blessed her, and she hath become nations--kings of peoples are from her.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Abraham falleth upon his face, and laugheth, and saith in his heart, `To the son of an hundred years is one born? or doth Sarah--daughter of ninety years--bear?'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Abraham saith unto God, `O that Ishmael may live before Thee;'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and God saith, `Sarah thy wife is certainly bearing a son to thee, and thou hast called his name Isaac, and I have established My covenant with him, for a covenant age-during, to his seed after him.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> As to Ishmael, I have heard thee; lo, I have blessed him, and made him fruitful, and multiplied him, very exceedingly; twelve princes doth he beget, and I have made him become a great nation;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and My covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah doth bear to thee at this appointed time in the next year;'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and He finisheth speaking with him, and God goeth up from Abraham.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Abraham taketh Ishmael his son, and all those born in his house, and all those bought with his money--every male among the men of Abraham's house--and circumciseth the flesh of their foreskin, in this self-same day, as God hath spoken with him.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Abraham [is] a son of ninety and nine years in the flesh of his foreskin being circumcised;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and Ishmael his son [is] a son of thirteen years in the flesh of his foreskin being circumcised;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> in this self-same day hath Abraham been circumcised, and Ishmael his son;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and all the men of his house--born in the house, and bought with money from the son of a stranger--have been circumcised with him.</p>
