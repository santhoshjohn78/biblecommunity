<h2>Jeremiah 44</h2>

<p><a id="c44_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The word that hath been unto Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who are dwelling in the land of Egypt--who are dwelling in Migdol, and in Tahpanhes, and in Noph, and in the land of Pathros--saying,</p>

<p><a id="c44_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Ye--ye have seen all the evil that I have brought in on Jerusalem, and on all the cities of Judah, and lo, they [are] a waste this day, and there is none dwelling in them,</p>

<p><a id="c44_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> because of their wickedness that they have done, by provoking Me to anger, by going to make perfume, by serving other gods, that they knew not, they, ye, and your fathers.</p>

<p><a id="c44_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> `And I send unto you all my servants, the prophets, rising early and sending, saying: I pray you, do not this abomination that I have hated--</p>

<p><a id="c44_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and they have not hearkened nor inclined their ear, to turn back from their wickedness, not to make perfume to other gods,</p>

<p><a id="c44_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and poured out is My fury, and Mine anger, and it burneth in cities of Judah, and in streets of Jerusalem, and they are for a waste, for a desolation, as [at] this day.</p>

<p><a id="c44_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `And, now, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Why are ye doing great evil unto your own souls, to cut off to you man and woman, infant and suckling, from the midst of Judah, so as not to leave to you a remnant:</p>

<p><a id="c44_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> by provoking Me to anger by the works of your hands, by making perfume to other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are going in to sojourn, so as to cut yourselves off, and so as to your being for a reviling and for a reproach among all nations of the earth?</p>

<p><a id="c44_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> `Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, that they have done in the land of Judah, and in streets of Jerusalem?</p>

<p><a id="c44_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> They have not been humbled unto this day, nor have they been afraid, nor have they walked in My law, and in My statutes, that I have set before you and before your fathers.</p>

<p><a id="c44_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> `Therefore, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I am setting my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah,</p>

<p><a id="c44_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and I have taken the remnant of Judah, who have set their faces to enter the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they have all been consumed in the land of Egypt; they fall by sword, by famine they are consumed, from the least even unto the greatest, by sword and by famine they die, and they have been for an execration, for an astonishment, and for a reviling, and for a reproach.</p>

<p><a id="c44_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> `And I have seen after those dwelling in the land of Egypt, as I saw after Jerusalem, with sword, with famine, and with pestilence,</p>

<p><a id="c44_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and there is not an escaped and remaining one of the remnant of Judah, who are entering into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, even to turn back to the land of Judah, whither they are lifting up their soul to return to dwell, for they donot turn back, except those escaping.'</p>

<p><a id="c44_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And they answer Jeremiah--all the men who are knowing that their wives are making perfume to other gods, and all the women who are remaining, a great assembly, even all the people who are dwelling in the land of Egypt, in Pathros--saying:</p>

<p><a id="c44_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> `The word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of Jehovah--we are not hearkening unto thee;</p>

<p><a id="c44_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> for we certainly do everything that hath gone out of our mouth, to make perfume to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out to her libations, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our heads, in cities of Judah, and in streets of Jerusalem, and--we are satisfied with bread, and we are well, and evil we have not seen.</p>

<p><a id="c44_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> `And from the time we have ceased to make perfume to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out to her libations, we have lacked all, and by sword and by famine we have been consumed,</p>

<p><a id="c44_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and when we are making perfume to the queen of the heavens, and pouring out to her libations--without our husbands have we made for her cakes to idolize her, and to pour out to her libations?'</p>

<p><a id="c44_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Jeremiah saith unto all the people, concerning the men and concerning the women, and concerning all the people who are answering him, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c44_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> `The perfume that ye made in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your heads, and the people of the land, hath not Jehovah remembered it? yea, it cometh up on His heart.</p>

<p><a id="c44_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Jehovah is not able any more to accept [you], because of the evil of your doings, because of the abominations that ye have done, and your land is for a waste, and for an astonishment, and for a reviling, without inhabitant, as [at] this day.</p>

<p><a id="c44_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> `Because that ye have made perfume, and because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, and in His law, and in His statutes, and in His testimonies ye have not walked, therefore hath this evil met you as [at] this day.'</p>

<p><a id="c44_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Jeremiah saith unto all the people, and unto all the women, `Hear ye a word of Jehovah, all Judah who [are] in the land of Egypt,</p>

<p><a id="c44_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Thus spake Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, saying: Ye and your wives both speak with your mouth, and with your hands have fulfilled, saying: We certainly execute our vows that we have vowed, to make perfume to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out to her libations, ye do certainly establish your vows, and certainly execute your vows.</p>

<p><a id="c44_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> `Therefore, hear ye a word of Jehovah, all Judah who are dwelling in the land of Egypt: Lo, I--I have sworn by My great name, said Jehovah, My name is no more proclaimed by the mouth of any man of Judah, saying, Live doth the Lord Jehovah--in all the land of Egypt.</p>

<p><a id="c44_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Lo, I am watching over them for evil, and not for good, and consumed have been all the men of Judah who [are] in the land of Egypt, by sword and by famine, till their consumption.</p>

<p><a id="c44_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> `And the escaped of the sword turn back out of the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, few in number, and known have all the remnant of Judah who are coming into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, whose word is established, Mine or theirs.</p>

<p><a id="c44_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> `And this [is] to you the sign--an affirmation of Jehovah--that I am seeing after you in this place, so that ye know that My words are certainly established against you for evil;</p>

<p><a id="c44_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Thus said Jehovah, Lo, I am giving Pharaoh-Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those seeking his life, as I have given Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and who is seeking his life.'</p>
