<h2>Leviticus 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, A woman when she giveth seed, and hath born a male, then she hath been unclean seven days, according to the days of separation for her sickness she is unclean;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and in the eighth day is the flesh of his foreskin circumcised;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and thirty and three days she doth abide in the blood of her cleansing; against any holy thing she doth not come, and unto the sanctuary she doth not go in, till the fulness of the days of her cleansing.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> `And if a female she bear, then she hath been unclean two weeks, as in her separation; and sixty and six days she doth abide for the blood of her cleansing.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> `And in the fulness of the days of her cleansing for son or for daughter she doth bring in a lamb, a son of a year, for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle-dove for a sinoffering, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, unto the priest;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and he hath brought it near before Jehovah, and hath made atonement for her, and she hath been cleansed from the fountain of her blood; this [is] the law of her who is bearing, in regard to a male or to a female.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> `And if her hand find not the sufficiency of a sheep, then she hath taken two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, one for a burnt-offering, and one for a sin-offering, and the priest hath made atonement for her, and she hath been cleansed.'</p>
