<p><a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the king Ahasuerus setteth a tribute on the land and the isles of the sea;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and all the work of his strength, and his might, and the explanation of the greatness of Mordecai with which the king made him great, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of Media and Persia?</p>

<p><a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For Mordecai the Jew [is] second to king Ahasuerus, and a great man of the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking good for his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.</p>
