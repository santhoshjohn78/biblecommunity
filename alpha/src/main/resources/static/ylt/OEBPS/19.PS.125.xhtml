<h2>Psalms 125</h2>

<p><a id="c125_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Song of the Ascents. Those trusting in Jehovah [are] as Mount Zion, It is not moved--to the age it abideth.</p>

<p><a id="c125_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jerusalem! mountains [are] round about her, And Jehovah [is] round about His people, From henceforth even unto the age.</p>

<p><a id="c125_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For the rod of wickedness resteth not On the lot of the righteous, That the righteous put not forth on iniquity their hands.</p>

<p><a id="c125_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Do good, O Jehovah, to the good, And to the upright in their hearts.</p>

<p><a id="c125_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> As to those turning [to] their crooked ways, Jehovah causeth them to go with workers of iniquity. Peace on Israel!</p>
