<p><a id="c34_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c34_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Command the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When ye are coming in unto the land of Canaan--this [is] the land which falleth to you by inheritance, the land of Canaan, by its borders--</p>

<p><a id="c34_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> then hath the south quarter been to you from the wilderness of Zin, by the sides of Edom, yea, the south border hath been to you from the extremity of the Salt Sea, eastward;</p>

<p><a id="c34_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and the border hath turned round to you from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and hath passed on to Zin, and its outgoings have been from the south to Kadesh-Barnea, and it hath gone out at Hazar-Addar, and hath passed on to Azmon;</p>

<p><a id="c34_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and the border hath turned round from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and its outgoings have been at the sea.</p>

<p><a id="c34_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> `As to the west border, even the great sea hath been to you a border; this is to you the west border.</p>

<p><a id="c34_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `And this is to you the north border: from the great sea ye mark out for yourselves mount Hor;</p>

<p><a id="c34_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> from mount Hor ye mark out to go in to Hamath, and the outgoings of the border have been to Zedad;</p>

<p><a id="c34_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and the border hath gone out to Ziphron, and its outgoings have been at Hazar- Enan; this is to you the north border.</p>

<p><a id="c34_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> `And ye have marked out for yourselves for the border eastward, from Hazar-Enan to Shepham;</p>

<p><a id="c34_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and the border hath gone down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east of Ain, and the border hath gone down, and hath smitten against the shoulder of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;</p>

<p><a id="c34_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and the border hath gone down to the Jordan, and its outgoings have been at the Salt Sea; this is for you the land by its borders round about.'</p>

<p><a id="c34_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Moses commandeth the sons of Israel, saying, `This [is] the land which ye inherit by lot, which Jehovah hath commanded to give to the nine tribes and the half of the tribe;</p>
