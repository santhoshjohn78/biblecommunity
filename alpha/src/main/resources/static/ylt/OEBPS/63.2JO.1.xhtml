<h2>2 John 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The Elder to the choice Kyria, and to her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those having known the truth,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> because of the truth that is remaining in us, and with us shall be to the age,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> there shall be with you grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I rejoiced exceedingly that I have found of thy children walking in truth, even as a command we did receive from the Father;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and now I beseech thee, Kyria, not as writing to thee a new command, but which we had from the beginning, that we may love one another,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and this is the love, that we may walk according to His commands; this is the command, even as ye did hear from the beginning, that in it ye may walk,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> because many leading astray did enter into the world, who are not confessing Jesus Christ coming in flesh; this one is he who is leading astray, and the antichrist.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> See to yourselves that ye may not lose the things that we wrought, but a full reward may receive;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> every one who is transgressing, and is not remaining in the teaching of the Christ, hath not God; he who is remaining in the teaching of the Christ, this one hath both the Father and the Son;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> if any one doth come unto you, and this teaching doth not bear, receive him not into the house, and say not to him, `Hail!'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> for he who is saying to him, `Hail,' hath fellowship with his evil works.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Many things having to write to you, I did not intend through paper and ink, but I hope to come unto you, and speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> salute thee do the children of thy choice sister. Amen.</p>
