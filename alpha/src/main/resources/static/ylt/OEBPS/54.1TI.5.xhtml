<h2>1 Timothy 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> An aged person thou mayest not rebuke, but be entreating as a father; younger persons as brethren;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> aged women as mothers, younger ones as sisters--in all purity;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> honour widows who are really widows;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and if any widow have children or grandchildren, let them learn first to their own house to show piety, and to give back a recompense to the parents, for this is right and acceptable before God.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And she who is really a widow and desolate, hath hoped upon God, and doth remain in the supplications and in the prayers night and day,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and she who is given to luxury, living--hath died;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and these things charge, that they may be blameless;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and if any one for his own--and especially for those of the household--doth not provide, the faith he hath denied, and than an unbeliever he is worse.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> A widow--let her not be enrolled under sixty years of age, having been a wife of one husband,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> in good works being testified to: if she brought up children, if she entertained strangers, if saints' feet she washed, if those in tribulation she relieved, if every good work she followed after;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and younger widows be refusing, for when they may revel against the Christ, they wish to marry,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> having judgment, because the first faith they did cast away,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and at the same time also, they learn [to be] idle, going about the houses; and not only idle, but also tattlers and busybodies, speaking the things they ought not;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I wish, therefore, younger ones to marry, to bear children, to be mistress of the house, to give no occasion to the opposer to reviling;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> for already certain did turn aside after the Adversary.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the assembly be burdened, that those really widows it may relieve.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The well-leading elders of double honour let them be counted worthy, especially those labouring in word and teaching,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> for the Writing saith, `An ox treading out thou shalt not muzzle,' and `Worthy [is] the workman of his reward.'</p>

<p><a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Against an elder an accusation receive not, except upon two or three witnesses.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Those sinning, reprove before all, that the others also may have fear;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> I testify fully, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the choice messengers, that these things thou mayest keep, without forejudging, doing nothing by partiality.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Be laying hands quickly on no one, nor be having fellowship with sins of others; be keeping thyself pure;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> no longer be drinking water, but a little wine be using, because of thy stomach and of thine often infirmities;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> of certain men the sins are manifest beforehand, leading before to judgment, and certain also they follow after;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> in like manner also the right works are manifest beforehand, and those that are otherwise are not able to be hid.</p>
