<h2>Titus 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And thou--be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of [their] husbands, lovers of [their] children,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> sober, pure, keepers of [their own] houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, incorruptibility,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Servants--to their own masters [are] to be subject, in all things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> not purloining, but showing all good stedfastness, that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!</p>
