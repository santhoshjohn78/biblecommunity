<h2>Hebrews 7</h2>

<p><a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of the kings, and did bless him,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, `King of righteousness,' and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)</p>

<p><a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like to the Son of God, doth remain a priest continually.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And see how great this one [is], to whom also a tenth Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;</p>

<p><a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath blessed,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is blessed--</p>

<p><a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there [he], who is testified to that he was living,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, hath paid tithes,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood--for the people under it had received law--what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?</p>

<p><a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the law a change doth come,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> for [it is] evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord, in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> for He doth testify--`Thou [art] a priest--to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'</p>

<p><a id="c7_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> (for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw nigh to God.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And inasmuch as [it is] not apart from oath, (for those indeed apart from oath are become priests,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him, `The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest--to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;')</p>

<p><a id="c7_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and those indeed are many who have become priests, because by death they are hindered from remaining;</p>

<p><a id="c7_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and he, because of his remaining--to the age, hath the priesthood not transient,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> whence also he is able to save to the very end, those coming through him unto God- -ever living to make intercession for them.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For such a chief priest did become us--kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens,</p>

<p><a id="c7_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;</p>

<p><a id="c7_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having infirmity, but the word of the oath that [is] after the law [appointeth] the Son--to the age having been perfected.</p>
