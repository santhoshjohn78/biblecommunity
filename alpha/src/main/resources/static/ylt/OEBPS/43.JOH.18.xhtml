<h2>John 18</h2>

<p><a id="c18_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> These things having said, Jesus went forth with his disciples beyond the brook of Kedron, where was a garden, into which he entered, himself and his disciples,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and Judas also, who delivered him up, had known the place, because many times did Jesus assemble there with his disciples.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Judas, therefore, having taken the band and officers out of the chief priests and Pharisees, doth come thither with torches and lamps, and weapons;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Jesus, therefore, knowing all things that are coming upon him, having gone forth, said to them, `Whom do ye seek?'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> they answered him, `Jesus the Nazarene;' Jesus saith to them, `I am [he];' --and Judas who delivered him up was standing with them; --</p>

<p><a id="c18_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> when, therefore, he said to them--`I am [he],' they went away backward, and fell to the ground.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Again, therefore, he questioned them, `Whom do ye seek?' and they said, `Jesus the Nazarene;'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Jesus answered, `I said to you that I am [he]; if, then, me ye seek, suffer these to go away;'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> that the word might be fulfilled that he said--`Those whom Thou hast given to me, I did not lose of them even one.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Simon Peter, therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the chief priest's servant, and cut off his right ear--and the name of the servant was Malchus--</p>

<p><a id="c18_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Jesus, therefore, said to Peter, `Put the sword into the sheath; the cup that the Father hath given to me, may I not drink it?'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The band, therefore, and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, took hold on Jesus, and bound him,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and they led him away to Annas first, for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was chief priest of that year,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews, that it is good for one man to perish for the people.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And following Jesus was Simon Peter, and the other disciple, and that disciple was known to the chief priest, and he entered with Jesus to the hall of the chief priest,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and Peter was standing at the door without, therefore went forth the other disciple who was known to the chief priest, and he spake to the female keeping the door, and he brought in Peter.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Then said the maid keeping the door to Peter, `Art thou also of the disciples of this man?' he saith, `I am not;'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and the servants and the officers were standing, having made a fire of coals, because it was cold, and they were warming themselves, and Peter was standing with them, and warming himself.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The chief priests, therefore, questioned Jesus concerning his disciples, and concerning his teaching;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Jesus answered him, `I spake freely to the world, I did always teach in a synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews do always come together; and in secret I spake nothing;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> why me dost thou question? question those having heard what I spake to them; lo, these have known what I said.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And he having said these things, one of the officers standing by did give Jesus a slap, saying, `Thus dost thou answer the chief priest?'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Jesus answered him, `If I spake ill, testify concerning the ill; and if well, why me dost thou smite?'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself, they said then to him, `Art thou also of his disciples?' he denied, and said, `I am not.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> One of the servants of the chief priest, being kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, `Did not I see thee in the garden with him?'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> again, therefore, Peter denied, and immediately a cock crew.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> They led, therefore, Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium, and it was early, and they themselves did not enter into the praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the passover;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Pilate, therefore, went forth unto them, and said, `What accusation do ye bring against this man?'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> they answered and said to him, `If he were not an evil doer, we had not delivered him to thee.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Pilate, therefore, said to them, `Take ye him--ye--and according to your law judge him;' the Jews, therefore, said to him, `It is not lawful to us to put any one to death;'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he said, signifying by what death he was about to die.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Pilate, therefore, entered into the praetorium again, and called Jesus, and said to him, `Thou art the King of the Jews?'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Jesus answered him, `From thyself dost thou say this? or did others say it to thee about me?'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> Pilate answered, `Am I a Jew? thy nation, and the chief priests did deliver thee up to me; what didst thou?'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Jesus answered, `My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my officers had struggled that I might not be delivered up to Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> Pilate, therefore, said to him, `Art thou then a king?' Jesus answered, `Thou dost say [it]; because a king I am, I for this have been born, and for this I have come to the world, that I may testify to the truth; every one who is of the truth,doth hear my voice.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> Pilate saith to him, `What is truth?' and this having said, again he went forth unto the Jews, and saith to them, `I do find no fault in him;</p>

<p><a id="c18_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> and ye have a custom that I shall release to you one in the passover; will ye, therefore, [that] I shall release to you the king of the Jews?'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> therefore they all cried out again, saying, `Not this one--but Barabbas;' and Barabbas was a robber.</p>
