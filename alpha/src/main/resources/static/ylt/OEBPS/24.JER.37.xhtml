<h2>Jeremiah 37</h2>

<p><a id="c37_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And reign doth king Zedekiah son of Josiah instead of Coniah son of Jehoiakim whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had caused to reign in the land of Judah,</p>

<p><a id="c37_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and he hath not hearkened, he, and his servants, and the people of the land, unto the words of Jehovah, that He spake by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Zedekiah the king sendeth Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, unto Jeremiah the prophet, saying, `Pray, we beseech thee, for us unto Jehovah our God.'</p>

<p><a id="c37_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Jeremiah is coming in and going out in the midst of the people, (and they have not put him in the prison-house),</p>

<p><a id="c37_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and the force of Pharaoh hath come out of Egypt, and the Chaldeans, who are laying siege against Jerusalem, hear their report, and go up from off Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c37_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Thus do ye say unto the king of Judah, who is sending you unto Me, to seek Me: Lo, the force of Pharaoh that is coming out to you for help hath turned back to its land, to Egypt,</p>

<p><a id="c37_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and the Chaldeans have turned back, and fought against this city, and captured it, and burnt it with fire.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> `Thus said Jehovah: Lift not up your souls saying, The Chaldeans surely go from off us, for they do not go;</p>

<p><a id="c37_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for though ye had smitten all the force of the Chaldeans who are fighting with you, and there were left of them wounded men--each in his tent--they rise, and have burnt this city with fire.'</p>

<p><a id="c37_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And it hath come to pass, in the going up of the force of the Chaldeans from off Jerusalem, because of the force of Pharaoh,</p>

<p><a id="c37_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> that Jeremiah goeth out from Jerusalem to go [to] the land of Benjamin, to receive a portion thence in the midst of the people.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And it cometh to pass, he is at the gate of Benjamin, and there [is] a master of the ward--and his name is Irijah son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah--and he catcheth Jeremiah the prophet, saying, `Unto the Chaldeans thou art falling.'</p>

<p><a id="c37_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Jeremiah saith, `Falsehood--I am not falling unto the Chaldeans;' and he hath not hearkened unto him, and Irijah layeth hold on Jeremiah, and bringeth him in unto the heads,</p>

<p><a id="c37_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and the heads are wroth against Jeremiah, and have smitten him, and put him in the prison-house--the house of Jonathan the scribe, for it they had made for a prison-house.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> When Jeremiah hath entered into the house of the dungeon, and unto the cells, then Jeremiah dwelleth there many days,</p>

<p><a id="c37_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and the king Zedekiah sendeth, and taketh him, and the king asketh him in his house in secret, and saith, `Is there a word from Jehovah?' And Jeremiah saith, `There is,' and he saith, `Into the hand of the king of Babylon thou art given.'</p>

<p><a id="c37_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Jeremiah saith unto the king Zedekiah, `What have I sinned against thee, and against thy servants, and against this people, that ye have given me unto a prison-house?</p>

<p><a id="c37_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And where [are] your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon doth not come in against you, and against this land?</p>

<p><a id="c37_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And now, hearken, I pray thee, my lord, O king, let my supplication fall, I pray thee, before thee, and cause me not to return [to] the house of Jonathan the scribe, that I die not there.'</p>

<p><a id="c37_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the king Zedekiah commandeth, and they commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, also to give to him a cake of bread daily from the bakers' street, till the consumption of all the bread of the city, and Jeremiah dwelleth in the court of the prison.</p>
