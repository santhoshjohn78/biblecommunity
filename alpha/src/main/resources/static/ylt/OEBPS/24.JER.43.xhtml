<h2>Jeremiah 43</h2>

<p><a id="c43_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it cometh to pass, when Jeremiah doth finish to speak unto all the people all the words of Jehovah their God, with which Jehovah their God hath sent him unto them--all these words--</p>

<p><a id="c43_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> that Azariah son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan son of Kareah, and all the proud men, speak unto Jeremiah, saying, `Falsehood thou art speaking; Jehovah our God hath not sent thee to say, Do not enter Egypt to sojourn there;</p>

<p><a id="c43_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> for Baruch son of Neriah is moving thee against us, in order to give us up into the hand of the Chaldeans, to put us to death, and to remove us to Babylon.'</p>

<p><a id="c43_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Johanan son of Kareah, and all the heads of the forces, and all the people, have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, to dwell in the land of Judah;</p>

<p><a id="c43_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and Johanan son of Kareah, and all the heads of the forces, take all the remnant of Judah who have turned from all the nations whither they were driven to sojourn in the land of Judah,</p>

<p><a id="c43_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> the men, and the women, and the infant, and the daughters of the king, and every person that Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners, had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch son of Neriah,</p>

<p><a id="c43_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and they enter the land of Egypt, for they have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, and they enter unto Tahpanhes.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c43_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> `Take in thy hand great stones, and thou hast hidden them, in the clay, in the brickkiln, that [is] at the opening of the house of Pharaoh in Tahpanhes, before the eyes of the men of Judah,</p>

<p><a id="c43_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and thou hast said unto them: Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: `Lo, I am sending, and I have taken Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and I have set his throne above these stones that I have hid, and he hath stretched out his pavilion over them,</p>

<p><a id="c43_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and he hath come, and smitten the land of Egypt--those who [are] for death to death, and those who [are] for captivity to captivity, and those who [are] for the sword to the sword.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I have kindled a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and it hath burned them, and he hath taken them captive, and covered himself with the land of Egypt, as cover himself doth the shepherd with his garment, and he hath gone forth thence in peace;</p>

<p><a id="c43_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and he hath broken the standing pillars of the house of the sun, that [is] in the land of Egypt, and the houses of the gods of Egypt he doth burn with fire.'</p>
