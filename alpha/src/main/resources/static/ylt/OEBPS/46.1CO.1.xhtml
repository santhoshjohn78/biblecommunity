<h2>1 Corinthians 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> to the assembly of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place--both theirs and ours:</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I give thanks to my God always concerning you for the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> that in every thing ye were enriched in him, in all discourse and all knowledge,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> according as the testimony of the Christ was confirmed in you,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> so that ye are not behind in any gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> who also shall confirm you unto the end--unblamable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> faithful [is] God, through whom ye were called to the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And I call upon you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that the same thing ye may all say, and there may not be divisions among you, and ye may be perfected in the same mind, and in the same judgment,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> for it was signified to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of Chloe, that contentions are among you;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and I say this, that each one of you saith, `I, indeed, am of Paul' --`and I of Apollos,' --`and I of Cephas,' --`and I of Christ.'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Hath the Christ been divided? was Paul crucified for you? or to the name of Paul were ye baptized;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I give thanks to God that no one of you did I baptize, except Crispus and Gaius--</p>

<p><a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> that no one may say that to my own name I did baptize;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and I did baptize also Stephanas' household--further, I have not known if I did baptize any other.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For Christ did not send me to baptize, but--to proclaim good news; not in wisdom of discourse, that the cross of the Christ may not be made of none effect;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> for the word of the cross to those indeed perishing is foolishness, and to us-- those being saved--it is the power of God,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> for it hath been written, `I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent I will bring to nought;'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> where [is] the wise? where the scribe? where a disputer of this age? did not God make foolish the wisdom of this world?</p>

<p><a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> for, seeing in the wisdom of God the world through the wisdom knew not God, it did please God through the foolishness of the preaching to save those believing.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Since also Jews ask a sign, and Greeks seek wisdom,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> also we--we preach Christ crucified, to Jews, indeed, a stumbling-block, and to Greeks foolishness,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and to those called--both Jews and Greeks--Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> for see your calling, brethren, that not many [are] wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> but the foolish things of the world did God choose, that the wise He may put to shame; and the weak things of the world did God choose that He may put to shame the strong;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and the base things of the world, and the things despised did God choose, and the things that are not, that the things that are He may make useless--</p>

<p><a id="c1_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> that no flesh may glory before Him;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and of Him ye--ye are in Christ Jesus, who became to us from God wisdom, righteousness also, and sanctification, and redemption,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> that, according as it hath been written, `He who is glorying--in the Lord let him glory.'</p>
