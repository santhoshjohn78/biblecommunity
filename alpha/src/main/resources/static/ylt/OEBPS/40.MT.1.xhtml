<h2>Matthew 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A roll of the birth of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar, and Pharez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and Ram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat Solomon, of her [who had been] Uriah's,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon, and Amon begat Josiah,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren, at the Babylonian removal.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And after the Babylonian removal, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and Zerubbabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and Azor begat Sadok, and Sadok begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was begotten Jesus, who is named Christ.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> All the generations, therefore, from Abraham unto David [are] fourteen generations, and from David unto the Babylonian removal fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian removal unto the Christ, fourteen generations.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: For his mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and Joseph her husband being righteous, and not willing to make her an example, did wish privately to send her away.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And on his thinking of these things, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream appeared to him, saying, `Joseph, son of David, thou mayest not fear to receive Mary thy wife, for that which in her was begotten [is] of the Holy Spirit,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And all this hath come to pass, that it may be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> `Lo, the virgin shall conceive, and she shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,' which is, being interpreted `With us [he is] God.'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Joseph, having risen from the sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord directed him, and received his wife,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and did not know her till she brought forth her son--the first-born, and he called his name Jesus.</p>
