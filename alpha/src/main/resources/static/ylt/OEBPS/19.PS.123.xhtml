<h2>Psalms 123</h2>

<p><a id="c123_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Song of the Ascents. Unto Thee I have lifted up mine eyes, O dweller in the heavens.</p>

<p><a id="c123_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Lo, as eyes of men-servants [Are] unto the hand of their masters, As eyes of a maidservant [Are] unto the hand of her mistress, So [are] our eyes unto Jehovah our God, Till that He doth favour us.</p>

<p><a id="c123_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Favour us, O Jehovah, favour us, For greatly have we been filled with contempt,</p>

<p><a id="c123_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Greatly hath our soul been filled With the scorning of the easy ones, With the contempt of the arrogant!</p>
