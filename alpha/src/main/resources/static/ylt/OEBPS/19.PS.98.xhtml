<h2>Psalms 98</h2>

<p><a id="c98_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm. Sing ye to Jehovah a new song, For wonders He hath done, Given salvation to Him hath His right hand and His holy arm.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah hath made known His salvation, Before the eyes of the nations, He hath revealed His righteousness,</p>

<p><a id="c98_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He hath remembered His kindness, And His faithfulness to the house of Israel, All ends of earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Shout to Jehovah, all the earth, Break forth, and cry aloud, and sing.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Sing to Jehovah with harp, With harp, and voice of praise,</p>

<p><a id="c98_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> With trumpets, and voice of a cornet, Shout ye before the king Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Roar doth the sea and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Floods clap hand, together hills cry aloud,</p>

<p><a id="c98_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Before Jehovah, For He hath come to judge the earth, He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the people in uprightness!</p>
