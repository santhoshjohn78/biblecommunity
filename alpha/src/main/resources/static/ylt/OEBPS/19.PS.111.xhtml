<h2>Psalms 111</h2>

<p><a id="c111_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise ye Jah! I thank Jehovah with the whole heart, In the secret meeting of the upright, And of the company.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Great [are] the works of Jehovah, Sought out by all desiring them.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Honourable and majestic is His work, And His righteousness is standing for ever.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> A memorial He hath made of His wonders, Gracious and merciful [is] Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Prey He hath given to those fearing Him, He remembereth to the age His covenant.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The power of His works He hath declared to His people, To give to them the inheritance of nations.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The works of His hands [are] true and just, Stedfast [are] all His appointments.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> They are sustained for ever to the age. They are made in truth and uprightness.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Redemption He hath sent to His people, He hath appointed to the age His covenant, Holy and fearful [is] His name.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The beginning of wisdom [is] fear of Jehovah, Good understanding have all doing them, His praise [is] standing for ever!</p>
