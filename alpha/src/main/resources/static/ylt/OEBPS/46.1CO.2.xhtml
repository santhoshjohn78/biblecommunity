<h2>1 Corinthians 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I, having come unto you, brethren, came--not in superiority of discourse or wisdom--declaring to you the testimony of God,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> for I decided not to know any thing among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and I, in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling, was with you;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and my word and my preaching was not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power--</p>

<p><a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> that your faith may not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And wisdom we speak among the perfect, and wisdom not of this age, nor of the rulers of this age--of those becoming useless,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a secret, that God foreordained before the ages to our glory,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> which no one of the rulers of this age did know, for if they had known, the Lord of the glory they would not have crucified;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> but, according as it hath been written, `What eye did not see, and ear did not hear, and upon the heart of man came not up, what God did prepare for those loving Him--'</p>

<p><a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> but to us did God reveal [them] through His Spirit, for the Spirit all things doth search, even the depths of God,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> for who of men hath known the things of the man, except the spirit of the man that [is] in him? so also the things of God no one hath known, except the Spirit of God.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And we the spirit of the world did not receive, but the Spirit that [is] of God, that we may know the things conferred by God on us,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> which things also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Holy Spirit, with spiritual things spiritual things comparing,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and the natural man doth not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for to him they are foolishness, and he is not able to know [them], because spiritually they are discerned;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and he who is spiritual, doth discern indeed all things, and he himself is by no one discerned;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> for who did know the mind of the Lord that he shall instruct Him? and we--we have the mind of Christ.</p>
