<p><a id="c100_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Serve Jehovah with joy, come before him with singing.</p>

<p><a id="c100_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Know that Jehovah He [is] God, He made us, and we are His, His people--and the flock of His pasture.</p>

<p><a id="c100_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Enter ye His gates with thanksgiving, His courts with praise, Give ye thanks to Him, bless ye His Name.</p>
