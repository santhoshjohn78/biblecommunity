<h2>Job 25</h2>

<p><a id="c25_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: --</p>

<p><a id="c25_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The rule and fear [are] with Him, Making peace in His high places.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Is their [any] number to His troops? And on whom ariseth not His light?</p>

<p><a id="c25_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And what? is man righteous with God? And what? is he pure--born of a woman?</p>

<p><a id="c25_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Lo--unto the moon, and it shineth not, And stars have not been pure in His eyes.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> How much less man--a grub, And the son of man--a worm!</p>
