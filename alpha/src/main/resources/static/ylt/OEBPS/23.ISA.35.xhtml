<h2>Isaiah 35</h2>

<p><a id="c35_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> They joy from the wilderness and dry place, And rejoice doth the desert, and flourish as the rose,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Flourishing it doth flourish, and rejoice, Yea, [with] joy and singing, The honour of Lebanon hath been given to it, The beauty of Carmel and Sharon, They--they see the honour of Jehovah, The majesty of our God.</p>

<p><a id="c35_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Strengthen ye the feeble hands, Yea, the stumbling knees strengthen.</p>

<p><a id="c35_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Say to the hastened of heart, `Be strong, Fear not, lo, your God; vengeance cometh, The recompence of God, He Himself doth come and save you.'</p>

<p><a id="c35_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Then opened are eyes of the blind, And ears of the deaf are unstopped,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Then leap as a hart doth the lame, And sing doth the tongue of the dumb, For broken up in a wilderness have been waters, And streams in a desert.</p>

<p><a id="c35_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the mirage hath become a pond, And the thirsty land fountains of waters, In the habitation of dragons, Its place of couching down, a court for reed and rush.</p>

<p><a id="c35_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And a highway hath been there, and a way, And the `way of holiness' is called to it, Not pass over it doth the unclean, And He Himself [is] by them, Whoso is going in the way--even fools err not.</p>

<p><a id="c35_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> No lion is there, yea, a destructive beast Ascendeth it not, it is not found there, And walked have the redeemed,</p>

<p><a id="c35_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the ransomed of Jehovah return, And have entered Zion with singing. And joy age-during on their head, Joy and gladness they attain, And fled away have sorrow and sighing!</p>
