<h2>Psalms 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of David, in his fleeing from the face of Absalom his son. Jehovah, how have my distresses multiplied! Many are rising up against me.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Many are saying of my soul, `There is no salvation for him in God.' Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Thou, O Jehovah, [art] a shield for me, My honour, and lifter up of my head.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> My voice [is] unto Jehovah: I call: And He answereth me from his holy hill, Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I--I have lain down, and I sleep, I have waked, for Jehovah sustaineth me.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I am not afraid of myriads of people, That round about they have set against me.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Rise, O Jehovah! save me, my God. Because Thou hast smitten All mine enemies [on] the cheek. The teeth of the wicked Thou hast broken.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Of Jehovah [is] this salvation; On Thy people [is] Thy blessing! Selah.</p>
