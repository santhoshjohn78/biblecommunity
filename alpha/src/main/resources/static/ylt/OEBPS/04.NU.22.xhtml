<h2>Numbers 22</h2>

<p><a id="c22_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the sons of Israel journey and encamp in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan, [by] Jericho.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Balak son of Zippor seeth all that Israel hath done to the Amorite,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and Moab is exceedingly afraid of the presence of the people, for it [is] numerous; and Moab is vexed by the presence of the sons of Israel,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and Moab saith unto the elders of Midian, `Now doth the assembly lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the green thing of the field.' And Balak son of Zippor [is] king of Moab at that time,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and he sendeth messengers unto Balaam son of Beor, to Pethor, which [is] by the River of the land of the sons of his people, to call for him, saying, `Lo, a people hath come out of Egypt; lo, it hath covered the eye of the land, and it is abiding over-against me;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and now, come, I pray thee, curse for me this people, for it [is] mightier than I; it may be I prevail--we smite it--and I cast it out from the land; for I have known--that which thou blessest is blessed, and that which thou cursest is cursed.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian go, and divinations in their hand, and they come in unto Balaam, and speak unto him the words of Balak,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and he saith unto them, `Lodge here to-night, and I have brought you back word, as Jehovah speaketh unto me;' and the princes of Moab abide with Balaam.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And God cometh in unto Balaam, and saith, `Who [are] these men with thee?'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Balaam saith unto God, `Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me:</p>

<p><a id="c22_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Lo, the people that is coming out from Egypt and covereth the eye of the land, -- now come, pierce it for me; it may be I am able to fight against it, and have cast it out;'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and God saith unto Balaam, `Thou dost not go with them; thou dost not curse the people; for it [is] blessed.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Balaam riseth in the morning, and saith unto the princes of Balak, `Go unto your land, for Jehovah is refusing to suffer me to go with you;'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and the princes of Moab rise, and come in unto Balak, and say, `Balaam is refusing to come with us.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Balak addeth yet to send princes, more numerous and honoured than these,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and they come in unto Balaam, and say to him, `Thus said Balak son of Zippor, Be not, I pray thee, withheld from coming unto me,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> for very greatly I honour thee, and all that thou sayest unto me I do; and come, I pray thee, pierce for me this people.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Balaam answereth and saith unto the servants of Balak, `If Balak doth give to me the fulness of his house of silver and gold, I am not able to pass over the command of Jehovah my God, to do a little or a great thing;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and, now, abide, I pray you, in this [place], you also, to-night; and I know what Jehovah is adding to speak with me.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And God cometh in unto Balaam, by night, and saith to him, `If to call for thee the men have come, rise, go with them, and only the thing which I speak unto thee--it thou dost do.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Balaam riseth in the morning, and saddleth his ass, and goeth with the princes of Moab,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and the anger of God burneth because he is going, and a messenger of Jehovah stationeth himself in the way for an adversary to him, and he is riding on his ass, and two of his servants [are] with him,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his drawn sword in his hand, and the ass turneth aside out of the way, and goeth into a field, and Balaam smiteth the ass to turn it aside into the way.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And the messenger of Jehovah standeth in a narrow path of the vineyards--a wall on this [side] and a wall on that--</p>

<p><a id="c22_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah, and is pressed unto the wall, and presseth Balaam's foot unto the wall, and he addeth to smite her;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and the messenger of Jehovah addeth to pass over, and standeth in a strait place where there is no way to turn aside--right or left--</p>

<p><a id="c22_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and the ass seeth the messenger of Jehovah, and croucheth under Balaam, and the anger of Balaam burneth, and he smiteth the ass with a staff.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And Jehovah openeth the mouth of the ass, and she saith to Balaam, `What have I done to thee that thou hast smitten me these three times?'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and Balaam saith to the ass, `Because thou hast rolled thyself against me; oh that there were a sword in my hand, for now I had slain thee;'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and the ass saith unto Balaam, `Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden since [I was] thine unto this day? have I at all been accustomed to do to thee thus?' and he saith, `No.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And Jehovah uncovereth the eyes of Balaam, and he seeth the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his drawn sword in his hand, and he boweth and doth obeisance, to his face;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and the messenger of Jehovah saith unto him, `Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? lo, I--I have come out for an adversary, for [thy] way hath been perverse before me,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> and the ass seeth me, and turneth aside at my presence these three times; unless she had turned aside from my presence, surely now also, thee I had slain, and her kept alive.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And Balaam saith unto the messenger of Jehovah, `I have sinned, for I did not know that thou [art] standing to meet me in the way; and now, if evil in thine eyes--I turn back by myself.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Balaam, `Go with the men; and only the word which I speak unto thee--it thou dost speak;' and Balaam goeth with the princes of Balak.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And Balak heareth that Balaam hath come, and goeth out to meet him, unto a city of Moab, which [is] on the border of Arnon, which [is] in the extremity of the border;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> and Balak saith unto Balaam, `Did I not diligently sent unto thee to call for thee? why didst thou not come unto me? am I not truly able to honour thee?'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And Balaam saith unto Balak, `Lo, I have come unto thee; now--am I at all able to speak anything? the word which God setteth in my mouth--it I do speak.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And Balaam goeth with Balak, and they come to Kirjath-Huzoth,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> and Balak sacrificeth oxen and sheep, and sendeth to Balaam, and to the princes who [are] with him;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> and it cometh to pass in the morning, that Balak taketh Balaam, and causeth him to go up the high places of Baal, and he seeth from thence the extremity of the people.</p>
