<h2>Psalms 124</h2>

<p><a id="c124_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Song of the Ascents, by David. Save [for] Jehovah--who hath been for us, (Pray, let Israel say),</p>

<p><a id="c124_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Save [for] Jehovah--who hath been for us, In the rising up of man against us,</p>

<p><a id="c124_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Then alive they had swallowed us up, In the burning of their anger against us,</p>

<p><a id="c124_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then the waters had overflowed us, The stream passed over our soul,</p>

<p><a id="c124_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Then passed over our soul had the proud waters.</p>

<p><a id="c124_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Blessed [is] Jehovah who hath not given us, A prey to their teeth.</p>

<p><a id="c124_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Our soul as a bird hath escaped from a snare of fowlers, The snare was broken, and we have escaped.</p>

<p><a id="c124_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Our help [is] in the name of Jehovah, Maker of the heavens and earth!</p>
