<h2>Judges 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And there is a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name [is] Micah,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and he saith to his mother, `The eleven hundred silverlings which have been taken of thine, and [of which] thou hast sworn, and also spoken in mine ears; lo, the silver [is] with me, I have taken it;' and his mother saith, `Blessed [is] my son of Jehovah.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he giveth back the eleven hundred silverlings to his mother, and his mother saith, `I had certainly sanctified the silver to Jehovah, from my hand, for my son, to make a graven image, and a molten image; and now, I give it back to thee.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he giveth back the money to his mother, and his mother taketh two hundred silverlings, and giveth them to a refiner, and he maketh them a graven image, and a molten image, and it is in the house of Micah.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> As to the man Micah, he hath a house of gods, and he maketh an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrateth the hand of one of his sons, and he is to him for a priest;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> in those days there is no king in Israel, each that which is right in his own eyes doth.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And there is a young man of Beth-Lehem-Judah, of the family of Judah, and he [is] a Levite, and he [is] a sojourner there.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the man goeth out of the city, out of Beth-Lehem-Judah, to sojourn where he doth find, and cometh to the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, to work his way.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Micah saith to him, `Whence comest thou?' and he saith unto him, `A Levite [am] I, of Beth-Lehem-Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I do find.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Micah saith to him, `Dwell with me, and be to me for a father and for a priest, and I give to thee ten silverlings for the days, and a suit of garments, and thy sustenance;' and the Levite goeth [in].</p>

<p><a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the Levite is willing to dwell with the man, and the young man is to him as one of his sons.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Micah consecrateth the hand of the Levite, and the young man is to him for a priest, and he is in the house of Micah,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and Micah saith, `Now I have known that Jehovah doth good to me, for the Levite hath been to me for a priest.'</p>
