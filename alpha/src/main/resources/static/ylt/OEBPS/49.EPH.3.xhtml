<h2>Ephesians 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you the nations,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> if, indeed, ye did hear of the dispensation of the grace of God that was given to me in regard to you,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> that by revelation He made known to me the secret, according as I wrote before in few [words] --</p>

<p><a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> in regard to which ye are able, reading [it], to understand my knowledge in the secret of the Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it was now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit--</p>

<p><a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> that the nations be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in the Christ, through the good news,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> of which I became a ministrant, according to the gift of the grace of God that was given to me, according to the working of His power;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> to me--the less than the least of all the saints--was given this grace, among the nations to proclaim good news--the untraceable riches of the Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and to cause all to see what [is] the fellowship of the secret that hath been hid from the ages in God, who the all things did create by Jesus Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> that there might be made known now to the principalities and the authorities in the heavenly [places], through the assembly, the manifold wisdom of God,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> according to a purpose of the ages, which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> in whom we have the freedom and the access in confidence through the faith of him,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> wherefore, I ask [you] not to faint in my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> of whom the whole family in the heavens and on earth is named,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> that He may give to you, according to the riches of His glory, with might to be strengthened through His Spirit, in regard to the inner man,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> that the Christ may dwell through the faith in your hearts, in love having been rooted and founded,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> that ye may be in strength to comprehend, with all the saints, what [is] the breadth, and length, and depth, and height,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> to know also the love of the Christ that is exceeding the knowledge, that ye may be filled--to all the fulness of God;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and to Him who is able above all things to do exceeding abundantly what we ask or think, according to the power that is working in us,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> to Him [is] the glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus, to all the generations of the age of the ages. Amen.</p>
