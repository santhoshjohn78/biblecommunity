<h2>Psalms 131</h2>

<p><a id="c131_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Song of the Ascents, by David. Jehovah, my heart hath not been haughty, Nor have mine eyes been high, Nor have I walked in great things, And in things too wonderful for me.</p>

<p><a id="c131_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Have I not compared, and kept silent my soul, As a weaned one by its mother? As a weaned one by me [is] my soul.</p>

<p><a id="c131_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Israel doth wait on Jehovah, From henceforth, and unto the age!</p>
