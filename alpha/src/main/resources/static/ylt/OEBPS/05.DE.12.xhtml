<h2>Deuteronomy 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> `These [are] the statutes and the judgments which ye observe to do in the land which Jehovah, God of thy fathers, hath given to thee to possess it, all the days that ye are living on the ground:</p>

<p><a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> ye do utterly destroy all the places where the nations which ye are dispossessing served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the heights, and under every green tree;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and ye have broken down their altars, and shivered their standing pillars, and their shrines ye burn with fire, and graven images of their gods ye cut down, and have destroyed their name out of that place.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> `Ye do not do so to Jehovah your God;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> but unto the place which Jehovah your God doth choose out of all your tribes to put His name there, to His tabernacle ye seek, and thou hast entered thither,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and hast brought in thither your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your free-will offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and ye have eaten there before Jehovah your God, and have rejoiced in every putting forth of your hand, ye and your households, with which Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> `Ye do not do according to all that we are doing here to-day, each anything that is right in his own eyes,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for ye have not come in hitherto unto the rest, and unto the inheritance, which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and ye have passed over the Jordan, and have dwelt in the land which Jehovah your God is causing you to inherit, and He hath given rest to you from all your enemies round about, and ye have dwelt confidently:</p>

<p><a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> `And it hath been, the place on which Jehovah your God doth fix to cause His name to tabernacle there, thither ye bring in all that which I am commanding you, your burntofferings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all the choice of your vows which ye vow to Jehovah;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and ye have rejoiced before Jehovah your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your handmaids, and the Levite who [is] within your gates, for he hath no part and inheritance with you.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> `Take heed to thee, lest thou cause thy burnt-offerings to ascend in any place which thou seest,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> except in the place which Jehovah doth choose in one of thy tribes, there thou dost cause thy burnt-offerings to ascend, and there thou dost do all that which I am commanding thee.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> `Only, with all the desire of thy soul thou dost sacrifice, and hast eaten flesh according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which He hath given to thee, in all thy gates; the unclean and the clean do eat it, as of the roe, and as of the hart.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> `Only, the blood ye do not eat--on the earth thou dost pour it as water;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> thou art not able to eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, and of thy new wine, and thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herd and of thy flock, and any of thy vows which thou vowest, and thy free-will offerings, and heave-offeringof thy hand;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> but before Jehovah thy God thou dost eat it, in the place which Jehovah thy God doth fix on, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy handmaid, and the Levite who [is] within thy gates, and thou hast rejoiced before Jehovah thy God in every putting forth of thy hand;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> take heed to thee lest thou forsake the Levite all thy days on thy ground.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> `When Jehovah thy God doth enlarge thy border, as He hath spoken to thee, and thou hast said, Let me eat flesh--for thy soul desireth to eat flesh--of all the desire of thy soul thou dost eat flesh.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> `When the place is far from thee which Jehovah thy God doth choose to put His name there, then thou hast sacrificed of thy herd and of thy flock which Jehovah hath given to thee, as I have commanded thee, and hast eaten within thy gates, of all the desire of thy soul;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> only, as the roe and the hart is eaten, so dost thou eat it; the unclean and the clean doth alike eat it.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> `Only, be sure not to eat the blood, for the blood [is] the life, and thou dost not eat the life with the flesh;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> thou dost not eat it, on the earth thou dost pour it as water;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> thou dost not eat it, in order that it may be well with thee, and with thy sons after thee, when thou dost that which [is] right in the eyes of Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> `Only, thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou dost take up, and hast gone in unto the place which Jehovah doth choose,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and thou hast made thy burnt-offerings--the flesh and the blood--on the altar of Jehovah thy God; and the blood of thy sacrifices is poured out by the altar of Jehovah thy God, and the flesh thou dost eat.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Observe, and thou hast obeyed all these words which I am commanding thee, in order that it may be well with thee and with thy sons after thee--to the age, when thou dost that which [is] good and right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> `When Jehovah thy God doth cut off the nations--whither thou art going in to possess them--from thy presence, and thou hast possessed them, and hast dwelt in their land--</p>

<p><a id="c12_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> take heed to thee, lest thou be snared after them, after their being destroyed out of thy presence, and lest thou enquire about their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods, and I do so--even I?</p>

<p><a id="c12_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> `Thou dost not do so to Jehovah thy God; for every abomination of Jehovah which He is hating they have done to their gods, for even their sons and their daughters they burn with fire to their gods.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> The whole thing which I am commanding you--it ye observe to do; thou dost not add unto it, nor diminish from it.</p>
