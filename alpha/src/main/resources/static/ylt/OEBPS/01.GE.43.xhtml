<h2>Genesis 43</h2>

<p><a id="c43_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the famine [is] severe in the land;</p>

<p><a id="c43_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and it cometh to pass, when they have finished eating the corn which they brought from Egypt, that their father saith unto them, `Turn back, buy for us a little food.'</p>

<p><a id="c43_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Judah speaketh unto him, saying, `The man protesting protested to us, saying, Ye do not see my face without your brother [being] with you;</p>

<p><a id="c43_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> if thou art sending our brother with us, we go down, and buy for thee food,</p>

<p><a id="c43_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and if thou art not sending--we do not go down, for the man said unto us, Ye do not see my face without your brother [being] with you.'</p>

<p><a id="c43_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Israel saith, `Why did ye evil to me, by declaring to the man that ye had yet a brother?'</p>

<p><a id="c43_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and they say, `The man asked diligently concerning us, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye a brother? and we declare to him according to the tenor of these things; do we certainly know that he will say, Bring down your brother?'</p>

<p><a id="c43_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Judah saith unto Israel his father, `Send the youth with me, and we arise, and go, and live, and do not die, both we, and thou, and our infants.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I--I am surety [for] him, from my hand thou dost require him; if I have not brought him in unto thee, and set him before thee--then I have sinned against thee all the days;</p>

<p><a id="c43_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for if we had not lingered, surely now we had returned these two times.'</p>

<p><a id="c43_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Israel their father saith unto them, `If so, now, this do: take of the praised thing of the land in your vessels, and take down to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds;</p>

<p><a id="c43_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and double money take in your hand, even the money which is brought back in the mouth of your bags, ye take back in your hand, it may be it [is] an oversight.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> `And take your brother, and rise, turn back unto the man;</p>

<p><a id="c43_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and God Almighty give to you mercies before the man, so that he hath sent to you your other brother and Benjamin; and I, when I am bereaved--I am bereaved.'</p>

<p><a id="c43_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the men take this present, double money also they have taken in their hand, and Benjamin; and they rise, and go down to Egypt, and stand before Joseph;</p>

<p><a id="c43_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and Joseph seeth Benjamin with them, and saith to him who [is] over his house, `Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal, and make ready, for with me do the men eat at noon.'</p>

<p><a id="c43_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the man doth as Joseph hath said, and the man bringeth in the men into the house of Joseph,</p>

<p><a id="c43_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and the men are afraid because they have been brought into the house of Joseph, and they say, `For the matter of the money which was put back in our bags at the commencement are we brought in--to roll himself upon us, and to throw himself on us, and to take us for servants--our asses also.'</p>

<p><a id="c43_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And they come nigh unto the man who [is] over the house of Joseph, and speak unto him at the opening of the house,</p>

<p><a id="c43_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and say, `O, my lord, we really come down at the commencement to buy food;</p>

<p><a id="c43_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and it cometh to pass, when we have come in unto the lodging-place, and open our bags, that lo, each one's money [is] in the mouth of his bag, our money in its weight, and we bring it back in our hand;</p>

<p><a id="c43_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food; we have not known who put our money in our bags.'</p>

<p><a id="c43_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And he saith, `Peace to you, fear not: your God and the God of your father hath given to you hidden treasure in your bags, your money came unto me;' and he bringeth out Simeon unto them.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And the man bringeth in the men into Joseph's house, and giveth water, and they wash their feet; and he giveth provender for their asses,</p>

<p><a id="c43_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and they prepare the present until the coming of Joseph at noon, for they have heard that there they do eat bread.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Joseph cometh into the house, and they bring to him the present which [is] in their hand, into the house, and bow themselves to him, to the earth;</p>

<p><a id="c43_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and he asketh of them of peace, and saith, `Is your father well? the aged man of whom ye have spoken, is he yet alive?'</p>

<p><a id="c43_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and they say, `Thy servant our father [is] well, he is yet alive;' and they bow, and do obeisance.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And he lifteth up his eyes, and seeth Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and saith, `Is this your young brother, of whom ye have spoken unto me?' and he saith, `God favour thee, my son.'</p>

<p><a id="c43_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Joseph hasteth, for his bowels have been moved for his brother, and he seeketh to weep, and entereth the inner chamber, and weepeth there;</p>

<p><a id="c43_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and he washeth his face, and goeth out, and refraineth himself, and saith, `Place bread.'</p>

<p><a id="c43_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And they place for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who are eating with him by themselves: for the Egyptians are unable to eat bread with the Hebrews, for it [is] an abomination to the Egyptians.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And they sit before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the young one according to his youth, and the men wonder one at another;</p>

<p><a id="c43_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> and he lifteth up gifts from before him unto them, and the gift of Benjamin is five hands more than the gifts of all of them; and they drink, yea, they drink abundantly with him.</p>
