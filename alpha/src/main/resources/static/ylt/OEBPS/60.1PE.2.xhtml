<h2>1 Peter 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Having put aside, then, all evil, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envyings, and all evil speakings,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> as new-born babes the word's pure milk desire ye, that in it ye may grow,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> if so be ye did taste that the Lord [is] gracious,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> to whom coming--a living stone--by men, indeed, having been disapproved of, but with God choice, precious,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and ye yourselves, as living stones, are built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Wherefore, also, it is contained in the Writing: `Lo, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone, choice, precious, and he who is believing on him may not be put to shame;'</p>

<p><a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> to you, then, who are believing [is] the preciousness; and to the unbelieving, a stone that the builders disapproved of, this one did become for the head of a corner,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence--who are stumbling at the word, being unbelieving, --to which also they were set;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and ye [are] a choice race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired, that the excellences ye may shew forth of Him who out of darkness did call you to His wondrous light;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> who [were] once not a people, and [are] now the people of God; who had not found kindness, and now have found kindness.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Beloved, I call upon [you], as strangers and sojourners, to keep from the fleshly desires, that war against the soul,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> having your behaviour among the nations right, that in that which they speak against you as evil-doers, of the good works having beheld, they may glorify God in a day of inspection.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Be subject, then, to every human creation, because of the Lord, whether to a king, as the highest,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> whether to governors, as to those sent through him, for punishment, indeed, of evildoers, and a praise of those doing good;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> because, so is the will of God, doing good, to put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> as free, and not having the freedom as the cloak of the evil, but as servants of God;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> to all give ye honour; the brotherhood love ye; God fear ye; the king honour ye.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The domestics! be subjecting yourselves in all fear to the masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the cross;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> for this [is] gracious, if because of conscience toward God any one doth endure sorrows, suffering unrighteously;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> for what renown [is it], if sinning and being buffeted, ye do endure [it]? but if, doing good and suffering [for it], ye do endure, this [is] gracious with God,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> for to this ye were called, because Christ also did suffer for you, leaving to you an example, that ye may follow his steps,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> who did not commit sin, nor was guile found in his mouth,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> who being reviled--was not reviling again, suffering--was not threatening, and was committing himself to Him who is judging righteously,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> who our sins himself did bear in his body, upon the tree, that to the sins having died, to the righteousness we may live; by whose stripes ye were healed,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> for ye were as sheep going astray, but ye turned back now to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.</p>
