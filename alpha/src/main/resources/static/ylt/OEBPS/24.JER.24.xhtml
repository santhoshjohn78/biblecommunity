<h2>Jeremiah 24</h2>

<p><a id="c24_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah hath shewed me, and lo, two baskets of figs, appointed before the temple of Jehovah, --after the removing by Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, of Jeconiah, son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the heads of Judah, and the artisan, and the smith, from Jerusalem, when he bringeth them into Babylon--</p>

<p><a id="c24_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> In the one basket [are] figs very good, like the first-ripe figs, and in the other basket [are] figs very bad, that are not eaten for badness.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Jehovah saith unto me, `What art thou seeing, Jeremiah?' and I say, `Figs, the good figs [are] very good, and the bad [are] very bad, that are not eaten for badness.'</p>

<p><a id="c24_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c24_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Like these good figs so do I acknowledge The removed of Judah--that I sent from this place, [To] the land of the Chaldeans--for good.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I have set Mine eyes on them for good, And have brought them back to this land, And built them up, and I throw not down, And have planted them, and pluck not up.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And have given to them a heart to know Me, For I [am] Jehovah, And they have been to Me for a people, And I am to them for God, For they turned back unto Me with all their heart.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And like the bad figs, that are not eaten for badness, Surely thus said Jehovah: So do I make Zedekiah king of Judah, And his heads, and the remnant of Jerusalem, Who are left in this land, And who are dwelling in the land of Egypt,</p>

<p><a id="c24_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And I have given them for a trembling, For evil--to all kingdoms of the earth, For a reproach, and for a simile, For a byword, and for a reviling, In all the places whither I drive them.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And I have sent against them the sword, The famine and the pestilence, Till their consumption from off the ground, That I gave to them and to their fathers!</p>
