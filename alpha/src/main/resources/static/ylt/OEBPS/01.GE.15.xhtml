<h2>Genesis 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> After these things hath the word of Jehovah been unto Abram in a vision, saying, `Fear not, Abram, I [am] a shield to thee, thy reward [is] exceeding great.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Abram saith, `Lord Jehovah, what dost Thou give to me, and I am going childless? and an acquired son in my house is Demmesek Eliezer.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Abram saith, `Lo, to me Thou hast not given seed, and lo, a domestic doth heir me.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And lo, the word of Jehovah [is] unto him, saying, `This [one] doth not heir thee; but he who cometh out from thy bowels, he doth heir thee;'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and He bringeth him out without, and saith, `Look attentively, I pray thee, towards the heavens, and count the stars, if thou art able to count them;' and He saith to him, `Thus is thy seed.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he hath believed in Jehovah, and He reckoneth it to him--righteousness.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And He saith unto him, `I [am] Jehovah who brought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to give to thee this land to possess it;'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and he saith, `Lord Jehovah, whereby do I know that I possess it?'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And He saith unto him, `Take for Me a heifer of three years, and a she-goat of three years, and a ram of three years, and a turtle-dove, and a young bird;'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and he taketh to him all these, and separateth them in the midst, and putteth each piece over against its fellow, but the bird he hath not divided;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and the ravenous birds come down upon the carcases, and Abram causeth them to turn back.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the sun is about to go in, and deep sleep hath fallen upon Abram, and lo, a terror of great darkness is falling upon him;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and He saith to Abram, `knowing--know that thy seed is a sojourner in a land not theirs, and they have served them, and they have afflicted them four hundred years,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and the nation also whom they serve I judge, and after this they go out with great substance;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and thou--thou comest in unto thy fathers in peace; thou art buried in a good old age;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and the fourth generation doth turn back hither, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And it cometh to pass--the sun hath gone in, and thick darkness hath been--and lo, a furnace of smoke, and a lamp of fire, which hath passed over between those pieces.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> In that day hath Jehovah made with Abram a covenant, saying, `To thy seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Phrat,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> with the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.'</p>
