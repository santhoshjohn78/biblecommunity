<h2>1 Corinthians 13</h2>

<p><a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> If with the tongues of men and of messengers I speak, and have not love, I have become brass sounding, or a cymbal tinkling;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and if I have prophecy, and know all the secrets, and all the knowledge, and if I have all the faith, so as to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and if I give away to feed others all my goods, and if I give up my body that I may be burned, and have not love, I am profited nothing.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The love is long-suffering, it is kind, the love doth not envy, the love doth not vaunt itself, is not puffed up,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> doth not act unseemly, doth not seek its own things, is not provoked, doth not impute evil,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> rejoiceth not over the unrighteousness, and rejoiceth with the truth;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> all things it beareth, all it believeth, all it hopeth, all it endureth.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The love doth never fail; and whether [there be] prophecies, they shall become useless; whether tongues, they shall cease; whether knowledge, it shall become useless;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for in part we know, and in part we prophecy;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and when that which is perfect may come, then that which [is] in part shall become useless.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> When I was a babe, as a babe I was speaking, as a babe I was thinking, as a babe I was reasoning, and when I have become a man, I have made useless the things of the babe;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> for we see now through a mirror obscurely, and then face to face; now I know in part, and then I shall fully know, as also I was known;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and now there doth remain faith, hope, love--these three; and the greatest of these [is] love.</p>
