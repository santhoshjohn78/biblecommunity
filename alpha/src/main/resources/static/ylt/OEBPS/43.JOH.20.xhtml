<h2>John 20</h2>

<p><a id="c20_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And on the first of the sabbaths, Mary the Magdalene doth come early (there being yet darkness) to the tomb, and she seeth the stone having been taken away out of the tomb,</p>

<p><a id="c20_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> she runneth, therefore, and cometh unto Simon Peter, and unto the other disciple whom Jesus was loving, and saith to them, `They took away the Lord out of the tomb, and we have not known where they laid him.'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Peter, therefore, went forth, and the other disciple, and they were coming to the tomb,</p>

<p><a id="c20_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and the two were running together, and the other disciple did run forward more quickly than Peter, and came first to the tomb,</p>

<p><a id="c20_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and having stooped down, seeth the linen clothes lying, yet, indeed, he entered not.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Simon Peter, therefore, cometh, following him, and he entered into the tomb, and beholdeth the linen clothes lying,</p>

<p><a id="c20_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and the napkin that was upon his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but apart, having been folded up, in one place;</p>

<p><a id="c20_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> then, therefore, entered also the other disciple who came first unto the tomb, and he saw, and did believe;</p>

<p><a id="c20_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for not yet did they know the Writing, that it behoveth him out of the dead to rise again.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The disciples therefore went away again unto their own friends,</p>

<p><a id="c20_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and Mary was standing near the tomb, weeping without; as she was weeping, then, she stooped down to the tomb, and beholdeth two messengers in white, sitting,</p>

<p><a id="c20_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And they say to her, `Woman, why dost thou weep?' she saith to them, `Because they took away my Lord, and I have not known where they laid him;'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and these things having said, she turned backward, and seeth Jesus standing, and she had not known that it is Jesus.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Jesus saith to her, `Woman, why dost thou weep? whom dost thou seek;' she, supposing that he is the gardener, saith to him, `Sir, if thou didst carry him away, tell me where thou didst lay him, and I will take him away;'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Jesus saith to her, `Mary!' having turned, she saith to him, `Rabbouni;' that is to say, `Teacher.'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Jesus saith to her, `Be not touching me, for I have not yet ascended unto my Father; and be going on to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and to your God.'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Mary the Magdalene cometh, telling to the disciples that she hath seen the Lord, and [that] these things he said to her.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> It being, therefore, evening, on that day, the first of the sabbaths, and the doors having been shut where the disciples were assembled, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith to them, `Peace to you;'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and this having said, he shewed them his hands and side; the disciples, therefore, rejoiced, having seen the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Jesus, therefore, said to them again, `Peace to you; according as the Father hath sent me, I also send you;'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and this having said, he breathed on [them], and saith to them, `Receive the Holy Spirit;</p>

<p><a id="c20_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> if of any ye may loose the sins, they are loosed to them; if of any ye may retain, they have been retained.'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came;</p>

<p><a id="c20_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> the other disciples, therefore, said to him, `We have seen the Lord;' and he said to them, `If I may not see in his hands the mark of the nails, and may put my finger to the mark of the nails, and may put my hand to his side, I will not believe.'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And after eight days, again were his disciples within, and Thomas with them; Jesus cometh, the doors having been shut, and he stood in the midst, and said, `Peace to you!'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> then he saith to Thomas, `Bring thy finger hither, and see my hands, and bring thy hand, and put [it] to my side, and become not unbelieving, but believing.'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And Thomas answered and said to him, `My Lord and my God;'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Jesus saith to him, `Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed; happy those not having seen, and having believed.'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Many indeed, therefore, other signs also did Jesus before his disciples, that are not written in this book;</p>

<p><a id="c20_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and these have been written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life in his name.'</p>
