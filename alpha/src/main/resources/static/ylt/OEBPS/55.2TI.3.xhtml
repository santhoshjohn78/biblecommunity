<h2>2 Timothy 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And this know thou, that in the last days there shall come perilous times,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> for men shall be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, evilspeakers, to parents disobedient, unthankful, unkind,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> without natural affection, implacable, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, not lovers of those who are good,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> traitors, heady, lofty, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> having a form of piety, and its power having denied; and from these be turning away,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the silly women, laden with sins, led away with desires manifold,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> always learning, and never to a knowledge of truth able to come,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and, even as Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, so also these do stand against the truth, men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> but they shall not advance any further, for their folly shall be manifest to all, as theirs also did become.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And thou--thou hast followed after my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> the persecutions, the afflictions, that befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of all the Lord did deliver me,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and all also who will to live piously in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and evil men and impostors shall advance to the worse, leading astray and being led astray.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And thou--be remaining in the things which thou didst learn and wast entrusted with, having known from whom thou didst learn,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and because from a babe the Holy Writings thou hast known, which are able to make thee wise--to salvation, through faith that [is] in Christ Jesus;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> every Writing [is] God-breathed, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for setting aright, for instruction that [is] in righteousness,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> that the man of God may be fitted--for every good work having been completed.</p>
