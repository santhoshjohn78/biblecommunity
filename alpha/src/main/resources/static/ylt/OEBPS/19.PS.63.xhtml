<h2>Psalms 63</h2>

<p><a id="c63_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of David, in his being in the wilderness of Judah. O God, Thou [art] my God, earnestly do I seek Thee, Thirsted for Thee hath my soul, Longed for Thee hath my flesh, In a land dry and weary, without waters.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> So in the sanctuary I have seen Thee, To behold Thy strength and Thine honour.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Because better [is] Thy kindness than life, My lips do praise Thee.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> So I bless Thee in my life, in Thy name I lift up my hands.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> As [with] milk and fatness is my soul satisfied, And [with] singing lips doth my mouth praise.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> If I have remembered Thee on my couch, In the watches--I meditate on Thee.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For Thou hast been a help to me, And in the shadow of Thy wings I sing.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Cleaved hath my soul after Thee, On me hath Thy right hand taken hold.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And they who for desolation seek my soul, Go in to the lower parts of the earth.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> They cause him to run on the edge of the sword, A portion for foxes they are.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the king doth rejoice in God, Boast himself doth every one swearing by Him, But stopped is the mouth of those speaking lies!</p>
