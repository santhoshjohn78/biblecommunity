<h2>Exodus 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron, in the land of Egypt, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `This month [is] to you the chief of months--it [is] the first to you of the months of the year;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> speak ye unto all the company of Israel, saying, In the tenth of this month--they take to them each man a lamb for the house of the fathers, a lamb for a house.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> `(And if the household be too few for a lamb, then hath he taken, he and his neighbour who is near unto his house, for the number of persons, each according to his eating ye do count for the lamb,)</p>

<p><a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> a lamb, a perfect one, a male, a son of a year, let be to you; from the sheep or from the goats ye do take [it].</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> `And it hath become a charge to you, until the fourteenth day of this month, and the whole assembly of the company of Israel have slaughtered it between the evenings;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and they have taken of the blood, and have put on the two side-posts, and on the lintel over the houses in which they eat it.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> `And they have eaten the flesh in this night, roast with fire; with unleavened things and bitters they do eat it;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> ye do not eat of it raw, or boiled at all in water, but roast with fire, its head with its legs, and with its inwards;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and ye do not leave of it till morning, and that which is remaining of it till morning with fire ye do burn.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> `And thus ye do eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand, and ye have eaten it in haste; it is Jehovah's passover,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and I have passed over through the land of Egypt during this night, and have smitten every first-born in the land of Egypt, from man even unto beast, and on all the gods of Egypt I do judgments; I [am] Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> `And the blood hath become a sign for you on the houses where ye [are], and I have seen the blood, and have passed over you, and a plague is not on you for destruction in My smiting in the land of Egypt.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> `And this day hath become to you a memorial, and ye have kept it a feast to Jehovah to your generations; --a statute age-during; ye keep it a feast.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Seven days ye eat unleavened things; only--in the first day ye cause leaven to cease out of your houses; for any one eating anything fermented from the first day till the seventh day, even that person hath been cut off from Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> `And in the first day [is] a holy convocation, and in the seventh day ye have a holy convocation; any work is not done in them, only that which is eaten by any person--it alone is done by you,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and ye have observed the unleavened things, for in this self-same day I have brought out your hosts from the land of Egypt, and ye have observed this day to your generations--a statute age-during.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> `In the first [month], in the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, ye do eat unleavened things until the one and twentieth day of the month, at evening;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> seven days leaven is not found in your houses, for any [one] eating anything fermented--that person hath been cut off from the company of Israel, among the sojourners or among the natives of the land;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> anything fermented ye do not eat, in all your dwellings ye do eat unleavened things.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Moses calleth for all the elders of Israel, and saith unto them, `Draw out and take for yourselves [from] the flock, for your families, and slaughter the passover-sacrifice;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and ye have taken a bunch of hyssop, and have dipped [it] in the blood which [is] in the basin, and have struck [it] on the lintel, and on the two side-posts, from the blood which [is] in the basin, and ye, ye go not out each from the opening of his house till morning.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> `And Jehovah hath passed on to smite the Egyptians, and hath seen the blood on the lintel, and on the two side-posts, and Jehovah hath passed over the opening, and doth not permit the destruction to come into your houses to smite.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> `And ye have observed this thing, for a statute to thee, and to thy sons--unto the age;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and it hath been, when ye come in unto the land which Jehovah giveth to you, as He hath spoken, that ye have kept this service;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and it hath come to pass when your sons say unto you, What [is] this service ye have?</p>

<p><a id="c12_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> that ye have said, A sacrifice of passover it [is] to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt, in His smiting the Egyptians, and our houses He delivered.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And the people bow and do obeisance, and the sons of Israel go and do as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron; so have they done.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And it cometh to pass, at midnight, that Jehovah hath smitten every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh who is sitting on his throne, unto the first-born of the captive who [is] in the prison-house, and every first-born of beasts.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Pharaoh riseth by night, he and all his servants, and all the Egyptians, and there is a great cry in Egypt, for there is not a house where there is not [one] dead,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and he calleth for Moses and for Aaron by night, and saith, `Rise, go out from the midst of my people, both ye and the sons of Israel, and go, serve Jehovah according to your word;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> both your flock and your herd take ye, as ye have spoken, and go; then ye have blessed also me.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And the Egyptians are urgent on the people, hasting to send them away out of the land, for they said, `We are all dead;'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> and the people taketh up its dough before it is fermented, their kneading-troughs [are] bound up in their garments on their shoulder.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And the sons of Israel have done according to the word of Moses, and they ask from the Egyptians vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> and Jehovah hath given the grace of the people in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they cause them to ask, and they spoil the Egyptians.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And the sons of Israel journey from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, apart from infants;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and a great rabble also hath gone up with them, and flock and herd--very much cattle.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And they bake with the dough which they have brought out from Egypt unleavened cakes, for it hath not fermented; for they have been cast out of Egypt, and have not been able to delay, and also provision they have not made for themselves.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And the dwelling of the sons of Israel which they have dwelt in Egypt [is] four hundred and thirty years;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> and it cometh to pass, at the end of four hundred and thirty years--yea, it cometh to pass in this self-same day--all the hosts of Jehovah have gone out from the land of Egypt.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> A night of watchings it [is] to Jehovah, to bring them out from the land of Egypt; it [is] this night to Jehovah of watchings to all the sons of Israel to their generations.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> And Jehovah saith unto Moses and Aaron, `This [is] a statute of the passover; Any son of a stranger doth not eat of it;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> and any man's servant, the purchase of money, when thou hast circumcised him-- then he doth eat of it;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> a settler or hired servant doth not eat of it;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> in one house it is eaten, thou dost not carry out of the house [any] of the flesh without, and a bone ye do not break of it;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> all the company of Israel do keep it.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v48"></a><span class="vn">48</span> `And when a sojourner sojourneth with thee, and hath made a passover to Jehovah, every male of his [is] to be circumcised, and then he doth come near to keep it, and he hath been as a native of the land, but any uncircumcised one doth not eat of it;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v49"></a><span class="vn">49</span> one law is to a native, and to a sojourner who is sojourning in your midst.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v50"></a><span class="vn">50</span> And all the sons of Israel do as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron; so have they done.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v51"></a><span class="vn">51</span> And it cometh to pass in this self-same day, Jehovah hath brought out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, by their hosts.</p>
