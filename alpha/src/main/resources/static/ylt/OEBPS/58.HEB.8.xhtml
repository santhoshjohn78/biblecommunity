<h2>Hebrews 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the sum concerning the things spoken of [is]: we have such a chief priest, who did sit down at the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> of the holy places a servant, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord did set up, and not man,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> for every chief priest to offer both gifts and sacrifices is appointed, whence [it is] necessary for this one to have also something that he may offer;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> for if, indeed, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest--(there being the priests who are offering according to the law, the gifts,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> who unto an example and shadow do serve of the heavenly things, as Moses hath been divinely warned, being about to construct the tabernacle, for `See (saith He) thou mayest make all things according to the pattern that was shewn to thee in the mount;') --</p>

<p><a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and now he hath obtained a more excellent service, how much also of a better covenant is he mediator, which on better promises hath been sanctioned,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> for if that first were faultless, a place would not have been sought for a second.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For finding fault, He saith to them, `Lo, days come, saith the Lord, and I will complete with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, a new covenant,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day of My taking [them] by their hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt--because they did not remain in My covenant, and I did not regard them, saith the Lord, --</p>

<p><a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> because this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws into their mind, and upon their hearts I will write them, and I will be to them for a God, and they shall be to Me fora people;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and they shall not teach each his neighbour, and each his brother, saying, Know thou the Lord, because they shall all know Me from the small one of them unto the great one of them,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will remember no more;' --</p>

<p><a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> in the saying `new,' He hath made the first old, and what doth become obsolete and is old [is] nigh disappearing.</p>
