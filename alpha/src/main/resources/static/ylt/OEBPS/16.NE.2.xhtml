<h2>Nehemiah 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it cometh to pass, in the month of Nisan, the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, wine [is] before him, and I lift up the wine, and give to the king, and I had not been sad before him;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and the king saith to me, `Wherefore [is] thy face sad, and thou not sick? this is nothing except sadness of heart;' and I fear very much,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and say to the king, `Let the king to the age live! wherefore should not my face be sad, when the city, the place of the graves of my fathers, [is] a waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?'</p>

<p><a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the king saith to me, `For what art thou seeking?' and I pray unto the God of the heavens,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and say to the king, `If to the king [it be] good, and if thy servant be pleasing before thee, that thou send me unto Judah, unto the city of the graves of my fathers, and I built it.'</p>

<p><a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the king saith to me (and the queen is sitting near him), `How long is thy journey? and when dost thou return?' and it is good before the king, and he sendeth me away, and I set to him a time.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I say to the king, `If to the king [it be] good, letters let be given to me for the governors beyond the River, that they let me pass over till that I come in unto Judah:</p>

<p><a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and a letter unto Asaph, keeper of the paradise that the king hath, that he give to me trees for beams [for] the gates of the palace that the house hath, and for the wall of the city, and for the house into which I enter;' and the king giveth to me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And I come in unto the governors beyond the River, and give to them the letters of the king; and the king sendeth with me heads of a force, and horsemen;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and Sanballat the Horonite heareth, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and it is evil to them--a great evil--that a man hath come in to seek good for the sons of Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And I come in unto Jerusalem, and I am there three days,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and I rise by night, I and a few men with me, and have not declared to a man what my God is giving unto my heart to do for Jerusalem, and there is no beast with me except the beast on which I am riding.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And I go out through the gate of the valley by night, and unto the front of the fountain of the dragon, and unto the gate of the dunghill, and I am measuring about the walls of Jerusalem, that are broken down, and its gates consumed with fire.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And I pass over unto the gate of the fountain, and unto the pool of the king, and there is no place for the beast under me to pass over,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and I am going up through the brook by night, and am measuring about the wall, and turn back, and come in through the gate of the valley, and turn back.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the prefects have not known whither I have gone, and what I am doing; and to the Jews, and to the priests, and to the freemen, and to the prefects, and to the rest of those doing the work, hitherto I have not declared [it];</p>

<p><a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and I say unto them, `Ye are seeing the evil that we are in, in that Jerusalem [is] waste, and its gates have been burnt with fire; come and we build the wall of Jerusalem, and we are not any more a reproach.'</p>

<p><a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And I declare to them the hand of my God that is good upon me, and also the words of the king that he said to me, and they say, `Let us rise, and we have built;' and they strengthen their hands for good.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And Sanballat the Horonite heareth, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, and they mock at us, and despise us, and say, `What [is] this thing that ye are doing? against the king are ye rebelling?'</p>

<p><a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And I return them word, and say to them, `The God of the heavens--He doth give prosperity to us, and we His servants rise and have built; and to you there is no portion, and right, and memorial in Jerusalem.'</p>
