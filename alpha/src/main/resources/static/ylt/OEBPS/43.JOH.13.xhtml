<h2>John 13</h2>

<p><a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour hath come, that he may remove out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own who [are] in the world--to the end he loved them.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And supper being come, the devil already having put [it] into the heart of Judas of Simon, Iscariot, that he may deliver him up,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jesus knowing that all things the Father hath given to him--into [his] hands, and that from God he came forth, and unto God he goeth,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> doth rise from the supper, and doth lay down his garments, and having taken a towel, he girded himself;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> afterward he putteth water into the basin, and began to wash the feet of his disciples, and to wipe with the towel with which he was being girded.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He cometh, therefore, unto Simon Peter, and that one saith to him, `Sir, thou--dost thou wash my feet?'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Jesus answered and said to him, `That which I do thou hast not known now, but thou shalt know after these things;'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Peter saith to him, `Thou mayest not wash my feet--to the age.' Jesus answered him, `If I may not wash thee, thou hast no part with me;'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Simon Peter saith to him, `Sir, not my feet only, but also the hands and the head.'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Jesus saith to him, `He who hath been bathed hath no need save to wash his feet, but he is clean altogether; and ye are clean, but not all;'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> for he knew him who is delivering him up; because of this he said, `Ye are not all clean.'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> When, therefore, he washed their feet, and took his garments, having reclined (at meat) again, he said to them, `Do ye know what I have done to you?</p>

<p><a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> ye call me, The Teacher and The Lord, and ye say well, for I am;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> if then I did wash your feet--the Lord and the Teacher--ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> `For an example I gave to you, that, according as I did to you, ye also may do;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> verily, verily, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his lord, nor an apostle greater than he who sent him;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> if these things ye have known, happy are ye, if ye may do them;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> not concerning you all do I speak; I have known whom I chose for myself; but that the Writing may be fulfilled: He who is eating the bread with me, did lift up against me his heel.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> `From this time I tell you, before its coming to pass, that, when it may come to pass, ye may believe that I am [he];</p>

<p><a id="c13_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> verily, verily, I say to you, he who is receiving whomsoever I may send, doth receive me; and he who is receiving me, doth receive Him who sent me.'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> These things having said, Jesus was troubled in the spirit, and did testify, and said, `Verily, verily, I say to you, that one of you will deliver me up;'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> the disciples were looking, therefore, one at another, doubting concerning whom he speaketh.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And there was one of his disciples reclining (at meat) in the bosom of Jesus, whom Jesus was loving;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Simon Peter, then, doth beckon to this one, to inquire who he may be concerning whom he speaketh,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and that one having leant back on the breast of Jesus, respondeth to him, `Sir, who is it?'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Jesus answereth, `That one it is to whom I, having dipped the morsel, shall give it;' and having dipped the morsel, he giveth [it] to Judas of Simon, Iscariot.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And after the morsel, then the Adversary entered into that one, Jesus, therefore, saith to him, `What thou dost--do quickly;'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and none of those reclining at meat knew for what intent he said this to him,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> for certain were thinking, since Judas had the bag, that Jesus saith to him, `Buy what we have need of for the feast;' or that he may give something to the poor;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> having received, therefore, the morsel, that one immediately went forth, and it was night.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> When, therefore, he went forth, Jesus saith, `Now was the Son of Man glorified, and God was glorified in him;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> if God was glorified in him, God also will glorify him in Himself; yea, immediately He will glorify him.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> `Little children, yet a little am I with you; ye will seek me, and, according as I said to the Jews--Whither I go away, ye are not able to come, to you also I do say [it] now.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> `A new commandment I give to you, that ye love one another; according as I did love you, that ye also love one another;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> in this shall all know that ye are my disciples, if ye may have love one to another.'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Simon Peter saith to him, `Sir, whither dost thou go away?' Jesus answered him, `Whither I go away, thou art not able now to follow me, but afterward thou shalt follow me.'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> Peter saith to him, `Sir, wherefore am I not able to follow thee now? my life for thee I will lay down;'</p>

<p><a id="c13_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> Jesus answered him, `Thy life for me thou wilt lay down! verily, verily, I say to thee, a cock will not crow till thou mayest deny me thrice.'</p>
