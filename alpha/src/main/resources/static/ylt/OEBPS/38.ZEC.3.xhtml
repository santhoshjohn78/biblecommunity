<h2>Zechariah 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And he sheweth me Joshua the high priest standing before the messenger of Jehovah, and the Adversary standing at his right hand, to be an adversary to him.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary: `Jehovah doth push against thee, O Adversary, Yea, push against thee doth Jehovah, Who is fixing on Jerusalem, Is not this a brand delivered from fire?'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and is standing before the messenger.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he answereth and speaketh unto those standing before him, saying: `Turn aside the filthy garments from off him.' And he saith unto him, `See, I have caused thine iniquity to pass away from off thee, so as to clothe thee with costly apparel.'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He also said, `Let them set a pure diadem on his head. And they set the pure diadem on his head, and clothe him with garments. And the messenger of Jehovah is standing,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and the messenger of Jehovah doth protest to Joshua, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: If in My ways thou dost walk, And if My charge thou dost keep, Then also thou dost judge My house, And also thou dost keep My courts, And I have given to thee conductors among these standing by.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Hear, I pray thee, Joshua, the high priest, Thou and thy companions sitting before thee, (For men of type [are] they,) For lo, I am bringing in My servant--a Shoot.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For lo, the stone that I put before Joshua, On one stone [are] seven eyes, Lo, I am graving its graving, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts, And I have removed the iniquity of that land in one day.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> In that day--an affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts, Ye do call, each unto his neighbour, Unto the place of the vine, And unto the place of the fig-tree!'</p>
