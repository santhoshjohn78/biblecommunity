<h2>Psalms 129</h2>

<p><a id="c129_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Song of the Ascents. Often they distressed me from my youth, Pray, let Israel say:</p>

<p><a id="c129_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Often they distressed me from my youth, Yet they have not prevailed over me.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Over my back have ploughers ploughed, They have made long their furrows.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Jehovah [is] righteous, He hath cut asunder cords of the wicked.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Confounded and turn backward do all hating Zion.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> They are as grass of the roofs, That before it was drawn out withereth,</p>

<p><a id="c129_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> That hath not filled the hand of a reaper, And the bosom of a binder of sheaves.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the passers by have not said, `The blessing of Jehovah [is] on you, We blessed you in the Name of Jehovah!'</p>
