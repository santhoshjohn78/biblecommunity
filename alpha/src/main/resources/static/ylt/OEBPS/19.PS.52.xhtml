<h2>Psalms 52</h2>

<p><a id="c52_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To the Overseer. --An instruction, by David, in the coming in of Doeg the Edomite, and he declareth to Saul, and saith to him, `David came in unto the house of Ahimelech.' What, boasteth thou in evil, O mighty one? The kindness of God [is] all the day.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Mischiefs doth thy tongue devise, Like a sharp razor, working deceit.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thou hast loved evil rather than good, Lying, than speaking righteousness. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thou hast loved all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Also--God doth break thee down for ever, Taketh thee, and pulleth thee out of the tent, And He hath uprooted thee Out of the land of the living. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the righteous see, And fear, and laugh at him.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `Lo, the man who maketh not God his strong place, And trusteth in the abundance of his riches, He is strong in his mischiefs.'</p>

<p><a id="c52_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I, as a green olive in the house of God, I have trusted in the kindness of God, To the age and for ever,</p>

<p><a id="c52_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I thank Thee to the age, because Thou hast done [it], And I wait [on] Thy name for [it is] good before Thy saints!</p>
