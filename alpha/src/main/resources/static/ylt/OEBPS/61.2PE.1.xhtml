<h2>2 Peter 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Simeon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who did obtain a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Grace to you, and peace be multiplied in the acknowledgement of God and of Jesus our Lord!</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> As all things to us His divine power (the things pertaining unto life and piety) hath given, through the acknowledgement of him who did call us through glory and worthiness,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> through which to us the most great and precious promises have been given, that through these ye may become partakers of a divine nature, having escaped from the corruption in the world in desires.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And this same also--all diligence having brought in besides, superadd in your faith the worthiness, and in the worthiness the knowledge,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and in the knowledge the temperance, and in the temperance the endurance, and in the endurance the piety,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and in the piety the brotherly kindness, and in the brotherly kindness the love;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> for these things being to you and abounding, do make [you] neither inert nor unfruitful in regard to the acknowledging of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for he with whom these things are not present is blind, dim-sighted, having become forgetful of the cleansing of his old sins;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> wherefore, the rather, brethren, be diligent to make stedfast your calling and choice, for these things doing, ye may never stumble,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> for so, richly shall be superadded to you the entrance into the age-during reign of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Wherefore, I will not be careless always to remind you concerning these things, though, having known them, and having been established in the present truth,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and I think right, so long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up in reminding [you],</p>

<p><a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> having known that soon is the laying aside of my tabernacle, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ did shew to me,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and I will be diligent that also at every time ye have, after my outgoing, power to make to yourselves the remembrance of these things.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> For, skilfully devised fables not having followed out, we did make known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but eye-witnesses having become of his majesty--</p>

<p><a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> for having received from God the Father honour and glory, such a voice being borne to him by the excellent glory: `This is My Son--the beloved, in whom I was well pleased;'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and this voice we--we did hear, out of heaven borne, being with him in the holy mount.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And we have more firm the prophetic word, to which we do well giving heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, till day may dawn, and a morning star may arise--in your hearts;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> this first knowing, that no prophecy of the Writing doth come of private exposition,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> for not by will of man did ever prophecy come, but by the Holy Spirit borne on holy men of God spake.</p>
