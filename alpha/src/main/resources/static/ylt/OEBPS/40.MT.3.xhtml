<h2>Matthew 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And in those days cometh John the Baptist, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and saying, `Reform, for come nigh hath the reign of the heavens,'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> for this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, `A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight make ye His paths.'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And this John had his clothing of camel's hair, and a girdle of skin round his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and honey of the field.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Then were going forth unto him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming about his baptism, he said to them, `Brood of vipers! who did shew you to flee from the coming wrath?</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> bear, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and do not think to say in yourselves, A father we have--Abraham, for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and now also, the axe unto the root of the trees is laid, every tree therefore not bearing good fruit is hewn down, and to fire is cast.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> `I indeed do baptize you with water to reformation, but he who after me is coming is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to bear the sandals, he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather his wheat to the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Then cometh Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan, unto John to be baptized by him,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> but John was forbidding him, saying, `I have need by thee to be baptized--and thou dost come unto me!'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But Jesus answering said to him, `Suffer now, for thus it is becoming to us to fulfil all righteousness,' then he doth suffer him.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and lo, opened to him were the heavens, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, `This is My Son--the Beloved, in whom I did delight.'</p>
