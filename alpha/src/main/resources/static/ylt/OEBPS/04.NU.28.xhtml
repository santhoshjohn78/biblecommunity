<p><a id="c28_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> `And thou hast said to them, This [is] the fire-offering which ye bring near to Jehovah: two lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones, daily, a continual burnt-offering;</p>

<p><a id="c28_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> the one lamb thou preparest in the morning, and the second lamb thou preparest between the evenings;</p>

<p><a id="c28_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and a tenth of the ephah of flour for a present, mixed with beaten oil, a fourth of the hin;</p>

<p><a id="c28_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and its libation, a fourth of the hin for the one lamb; in the sanctuary cause thou a libation of strong drink to be poured out to Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> `And the second lamb thou dost prepare between the evenings; as the present of the morning, and as its libation thou preparest--a fire-offering, a sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> `And on the sabbath-day, two lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones, and two-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, and its libation;</p>
