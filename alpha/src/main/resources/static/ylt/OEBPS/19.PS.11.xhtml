<h2>Psalms 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To the Overseer. --By David. In Jehovah I trusted, how say ye to my soul, `They moved [to] Thy mountain for the bird?</p>

<p><a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For lo, the wicked tread a bow, They have prepared their arrow on the string, To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> When the foundations are destroyed, The righteous--what hath he done?</p>

<p><a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> `Jehovah [is] in his holy temple: Jehovah--in the heavens [is] His throne. His eyes see--His eyelids try the sons of men.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Jehovah the righteous doth try. And the wicked and the lover of violence, Hath His soul hated,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He poureth on the wicked snares, fire, and brimstone, And a horrible wind [is] the portion of their cup.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For righteous [is] Jehovah, Righteousness He hath loved, The upright doth His countenance see!'</p>
