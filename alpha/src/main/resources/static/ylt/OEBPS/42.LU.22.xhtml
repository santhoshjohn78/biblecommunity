<h2>Luke 22</h2>

<p><a id="c22_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the feast of the unleavened food was coming nigh, that is called Passover,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they may take him up, for they were afraid of the people.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the Adversary entered into Judas, who is surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and he, having gone away, spake with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might deliver him up to them,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and they rejoiced, and covenanted to give him money,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and he agreed, and was seeking a favourable season to deliver him up to them without tumult.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the day of the unleavened food came, in which it was behoving the passover to be sacrificed,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and he sent Peter and John, saying, `Having gone on, prepare to us the passover, that we may eat;'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and they said to him, `Where wilt thou that we might prepare?'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he said to them, `Lo, in your entering into the city, there shall meet you a man, bearing a pitcher of water, follow him to the house where he doth go in,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith to thee, Where is the guest-chamber where the passover with my disciples I may eat?</p>

<p><a id="c22_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and he shall show you a large upper room furnished, there make ready;'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and they, having gone away, found as he hath said to them, and they made ready the passover.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And when the hour come, he reclined (at meat), and the twelve apostles with him,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and he said unto them, `With desire I did desire to eat this passover with you before my suffering,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> for I say to you, that no more may I eat of it till it may be fulfilled in the reign of God.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And having taken a cup, having given thanks, he said, `Take this and divide to yourselves,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> for I say to you that I may not drink of the produce of the vine till the reign of God may come.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And having taken bread, having given thanks, he brake and gave to them, saying, `This is my body, that for you is being given, this do ye--to remembrance of me.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> In like manner, also, the cup after the supping, saying, `This cup [is] the new covenant in my blood, that for you is being poured forth.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> `But, lo, the hand of him delivering me up [is] with me on the table,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and indeed the Son of Man doth go according to what hath been determined; but woe to that man through whom he is being delivered up.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And they began to reason among themselves, who then of them it may be, who is about to do this thing.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And there happened also a strife among them--who of them is accounted to be greater.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And he said to them, `The kings of the nations do exercise lordship over them, and those exercising authority upon them are called benefactors;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> but ye [are] not so, but he who is greater among you--let him be as the younger; and he who is leading, as he who is ministering;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> for who is greater? he who is reclining (at meat), or he who is ministering? is it not he who is reclining (at meat)? and I--I am in your midst as he who is ministering.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> `And ye--ye are those who have remained with me in my temptations,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and I appoint to you, as my Father did appoint to me, a kingdom,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> that ye may eat and may drink at my table, in my kingdom, and may sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And the Lord said, `Simon, Simon, lo, the Adversary did ask you for himself to sift as the wheat,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and I besought for thee, that thy faith may not fail; and thou, when thou didst turn, strengthen thy brethren.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And he said to him, `Sir, with thee I am ready both to prison and to death to go;'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> and he said, `I say to thee, Peter, a cock shall not crow to-day, before thrice thou mayest disown knowing me.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And he said to them, `When I sent you without bag, and scrip, and sandals, did ye lack anything?' and they said, `Nothing.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Then said he to them, `But, now, he who is having a bag, let him take [it] up, and in like manner also a scrip; and he who is not having, let him sell his garment, and buy a sword,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> for I say to you, that yet this that hath been written it behoveth to be fulfilled in me: And with lawless ones he was reckoned, for also the things concerning me have an end.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And they said, `Sir, lo, here [are] two swords;' and he said to them, `It is sufficient.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And having gone forth, he went on, according to custom, to the mount of the Olives, and his disciples also followed him,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> and having come to the place, he said to them, `Pray ye not to enter into temptation.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And he was withdrawn from them, as it were a stone's cast, and having fallen on the knees he was praying,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> saying, `Father, if Thou be counselling to make this cup pass from me--;but, not my will, but Thine be done.' --</p>

<p><a id="c22_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> And there appeared to him a messenger from heaven strengthening him;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> and having been in agony, he was more earnestly praying, and his sweat became, as it were, great drops of blood falling upon the ground.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> And having risen up from the prayer, having come unto the disciples, he found them sleeping from the sorrow,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> and he said to them, `Why do ye sleep? having risen, pray that ye may not enter into temptation.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> And while he is speaking, lo, a multitude, and he who is called Judas, one of the twelve, was coming before them, and he came nigh to Jesus to kiss him,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v48"></a><span class="vn">48</span> and Jesus said to him, `Judas, with a kiss the Son of Man dost thou deliver up?'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v49"></a><span class="vn">49</span> And those about him, having seen what was about to be, said to him, `Sir, shall we smite with a sword?'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v50"></a><span class="vn">50</span> And a certain one of them smote the servant of the chief priest, and took off his right ear,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v51"></a><span class="vn">51</span> and Jesus answering said, `Suffer ye thus far,' and having touched his ear, he healed him.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v52"></a><span class="vn">52</span> And Jesus said to those having come upon him--chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and elders--`As upon a robber have ye come forth, with swords and sticks?</p>

<p><a id="c22_v53"></a><span class="vn">53</span> while daily I was with you in the temple, ye did stretch forth no hands against me; but this is your hour and the power of the darkness.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v54"></a><span class="vn">54</span> And having taken him, they led and brought him to the house of the chief priest. And Peter was following afar off,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v55"></a><span class="vn">55</span> and they having kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and having sat down together, Peter was sitting in the midst of them,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v56"></a><span class="vn">56</span> and a certain maid having seen him sitting at the light, and having earnestly looked at him, she said, `And this one was with him!'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v57"></a><span class="vn">57</span> and he disowned him, saying, `Woman, I have not known him.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v58"></a><span class="vn">58</span> And after a little, another having seen him, said, `And thou art of them!' and Peter said, `Man, I am not.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v59"></a><span class="vn">59</span> And one hour, as it were, having intervened, a certain other was confidently affirming, saying, `Of a truth this one also was with him, for he is also a Galilean;'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v60"></a><span class="vn">60</span> and Peter said, `Man, I have not known what thou sayest;' and presently, while he is speaking, a cock crew.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v61"></a><span class="vn">61</span> And the Lord having turned did look on Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him--`Before a cock shall crow, thou mayest disown me thrice;'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v62"></a><span class="vn">62</span> and Peter having gone without, wept bitterly.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v63"></a><span class="vn">63</span> And the men who were holding Jesus were mocking him, beating [him];</p>

<p><a id="c22_v64"></a><span class="vn">64</span> and having blindfolded him, they were striking him on the face, and were questioning him, saying, `Prophesy who he is who smote thee?'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v65"></a><span class="vn">65</span> and many other things, speaking evilly, they spake in regard to him.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v66"></a><span class="vn">66</span> And when it became day there was gathered together the eldership of the people, chief priests also, and scribes, and they led him up to their own sanhedrim,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v67"></a><span class="vn">67</span> saying, `If thou be the Christ, tell us.' And he said to them, `If I may tell you, ye will not believe;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v68"></a><span class="vn">68</span> and if I also question [you], ye will not answer me or send me away;</p>

<p><a id="c22_v69"></a><span class="vn">69</span> henceforth, there shall be the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power of God.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v70"></a><span class="vn">70</span> And they all said, `Thou, then, art the Son of God?' and he said unto them, `Ye say [it], because I am;'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v71"></a><span class="vn">71</span> and they said, `What need yet have we of testimony? for we ourselves did hear [it] from his mouth.'</p>
