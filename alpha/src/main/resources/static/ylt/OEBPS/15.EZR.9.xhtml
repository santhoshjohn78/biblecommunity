<h2>Ezra 9</h2>

<p><a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And at the completion of these things, drawn nigh unto me have the heads, saying, `The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not been separated from the peoples of the lands, as to their abominations, even the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, the Ammonite, the Moabite, the Egyptian, and the Amorite,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> for they have taken of their daughters to them, and to their sons, and the holy seed have mingled themselves among the peoples of the lands, and the hand of the heads and of the seconds have been first in this trespass.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And at my hearing this word, I have rent my garment and my upper robe, and pluck out of the hair of my head, and of my beard, and sit astonished,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and unto me are gathered every one trembling at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of the removal, and I am sitting astonished till the present of the evening.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And at the present of the evening I have risen from mine affliction, and at my rending my garment and my upper robe, then I bow down on my knees, and spread out my hands unto Jehovah my God,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and say, `O my God, I have been ashamed, and have blushed to lift up, O my God, my face unto Thee, for our iniquities have increased over the head, and our guilt hath become great unto the heavens.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `From the days of our fathers we [are] in great guilt unto this day, and in our iniquities we have been given--we, our kings, our priests--into the hand of the kings of the lands, with sword, with captivity, and with spoiling, and with shame of face, as [at] this day.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> `And now, as a small moment hath grace been from Jehovah our God, to leave to us an escape, and to give to us a nail in His holy place, by our God's enlightening our eyes, and by giving us a little quickening in our servitude;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for servants we [are], and in our servitude our God hath not forsaken us, and stretcheth out unto us kindness before the kings of Persia, to give to us a quickening to lift up the house of our God, and to cause its wastes to cease, and to give to us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> `And now, what do we say, O our God, after this? for we have forsaken Thy commands,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> that Thou hast commanded by the hands of thy servants the prophets, saying, The land into which ye are going to possess it, [is] a land of impurity, by the impurity of the people of the lands, by their abominations with which they have filled it--from mouth unto mouth--by their uncleanness;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and now, your daughters ye do not give to their sons, and their daughters ye do not take to your sons, and ye do not seek their peace, and their good--unto the age, so that ye are strong, and have eaten the good of the land, and given possession to your sons unto the age.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> `And after all that hath come upon us for our evil works, and for our great guilt (for Thou, O our God, hast kept back of the rod from our iniquities, and hast given to us an escape like this),</p>

<p><a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> do we turn back to break Thy commands, and to join ourselves in marriage with the people of these abominations? art not Thou angry against us--even to consumption--till there is no remnant and escaped part?</p>

<p><a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> `O Jehovah, God of Israel, righteous [art] Thou, for we have been left an escape, as [it is] this day; lo, we [are] before Thee in our guilt, for there is none to stand before Thee concerning this.'</p>
