<h2>2 Samuel 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah sendeth Nathan unto David, and he cometh unto him, and saith to him: `Two men have been in one city; One rich and one poor;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The rich hath flocks and herds very many;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the poor one hath nothing, Except one little ewe-lamb, Which he hath bought, and keepeth alive, And it groweth up with him, And with his sons together; Of his morsel it eateth, And from his cup it drinketh, And in his bosom it lieth, And it is to him as a daughter;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And there cometh a traveller to the rich man, And he spareth to take Of his own flock, and of his own herd, To prepare for the traveller Who hath come to him, And he taketh the ewe-lamb of the poor man, And prepareth it for the man Who hathcome unto him.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the anger of David burneth against the man exceedingly, and he saith unto Nathan, `Jehovah liveth, surely a son of death [is] the man who is doing this,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and the ewe-lamb he doth repay fourfold, because that he hath done this thing, and because that he had no pity.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Nathan saith unto David, `Thou [art] the man! Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, I anointed thee for king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and I give to thee the house of thy lord, and the wives of thy lord, into thy bosom, and I give to thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if little, then I add to thee such and such [things].</p>

<p><a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> `Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do the evil thing in His eyes? Uriah the Hittite thou hast smitten by the sword, and his wife thou hast taken to thee for a wife, and him thou hast slain by the sword of the Bene-Ammon.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> `And now, the sword doth not turn aside from thy house unto the age, because thou hast despised Me, and dost take the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be to thee for a wife;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> thus said Jehovah, Lo, I am raising up against thee evil, out of thy house, and have taken thy wives before thine eyes, and given to thy neighbour, and he hath lain with thy wives before the eyes of this sun;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> for thou hast done [it] in secret, and I do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And David saith unto Nathan, `I have sinned against Jehovah.' And Nathan saith unto David, `Also--Jehovah hath caused thy sin to pass away; thou dost not die;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> only, because thou hast caused the enemies of Jehovah greatly to despise by this thing, also the son who is born to thee doth surely die.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Nathan goeth unto his house, and Jehovah smiteth the lad, whom the wife of Uriah hath born to David, and it is incurable;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and David seeketh God for the youth, and David keepeth a fast, and hath gone in and lodged, and lain on the earth.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the elders of his house rise against him, to raise him up from the earth, and he hath not been willing, nor hath he eaten with them bread;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and it cometh to pass on the seventh day, that the lad dieth, and the servants of David fear to declare to him that the lad is dead, for they said, `Lo, in the lad being alive we spake unto him, and he did not hearken to our voice; and howdo we say unto him, The lad is dead? --then he hath done evil.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And David seeth that his servants are whispering, and David understandeth that the lad is dead, and David saith unto his servants, `Is the lad dead?' and they say, `Dead.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And David riseth from the earth, and doth bathe and anoint [himself], and changeth his raiment, and cometh in to the house of Jehovah, and boweth himself, and cometh unto his house, and asketh and they place for him bread, and he eateth.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And his servants say unto him, `What [is] this thing thou hast done? because of the living lad thou hast fasted and dost weep, and when the lad is dead thou hast risen and dost eat bread.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And he saith, `While the lad is alive I have fasted, and weep, for I said, Who knoweth? --Jehovah doth pity me, and the lad hath lived;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and now, he hath died, why [is] this--I fast? am I able to bring him back again? I am going unto him, and he doth not turn back unto me.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And David comforteth Bath-Sheba his wife, and goeth in unto her, and lieth with her, and she beareth a son, and he calleth his name Solomon; and Jehovah hath loved him,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and sendeth by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and calleth his name Jedidiah, because of Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Joab fighteth against Rabbah of the Bene-Ammon, and captureth the royal city,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and Joab sendeth messengers unto David, and saith, `I have fought against Rabbah--also I have captured the city of waters;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and now, gather the rest of the people, and encamp against the city, and capture it, lest I capture the city, and my name hath been called upon it.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And David gathereth all the people, and goeth to Rabbah, and fighteth against it, and captureth it;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and he taketh the crown of their king from off his head, and its weight [is] a talent of gold, and precious stones, and it is on the head of David; and the spoil of the city he hath brought out, very much;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and the people who [are] in it he hath brought out, and setteth to the saw, and to cutting instruments of iron, and to axes of iron, and hath caused them to pass over into the brickkiln; and so he doth to all the cities of the Bene-Ammon;and David turneth back, and all the people, to Jerusalem.</p>
