<h2>Titus 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, unto every good work to be ready,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome--gentle, showing all meekness to all men,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> for we were once--also we--thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold, in malice and envy living, odious--hating one another;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> (not by works that [are] in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness,) He did save us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Stedfast [is] the word; and concerning these things I counsel thee to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works--who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from--for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be rejecting,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> having known that he hath been subverted who [is] such, and doth sin, being selfcondemned.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis, for there to winter I have determined.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and let them learn--ours also--to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Salute thee do all those with me; salute those loving us in faith; the grace [is] with you all!</p>
