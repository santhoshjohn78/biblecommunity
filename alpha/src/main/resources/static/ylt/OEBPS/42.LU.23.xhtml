<h2>Luke 23</h2>

<p><a id="c23_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And having risen, the whole multitude of them did lead him to Pilate,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and began to accuse him, saying, `This one we found perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying himself to be Christ a king.'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Pilate questioned him, saying, `Thou art the king of the Jews?' and he answering him, said, `Thou dost say [it].'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Pilate said unto the chief priests, and the multitude, `I find no fault in this man;'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and they were the more urgent, saying--`He doth stir up the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea--having begun from Galilee--unto this place.'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Pilate having heard of Galilee, questioned if the man is a Galilean,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and having known that he is from the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him back unto Herod, he being also in Jerusalem in those days.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Herod having seen Jesus did rejoice exceedingly, for he was wishing for a long [time] to see him, because of hearing many things about him, and he was hoping some sign to see done by him,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and was questioning him in many words, and he answered him nothing.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the chief priests and the scribes stood vehemently accusing him,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and Herod with his soldiers having set him at nought, and having mocked, having put around him gorgeous apparel, did send him back to Pilate,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and both Pilate and Herod became friends on that day with one another, for they were before at enmity between themselves.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Pilate having called together the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> said unto them, `Ye brought to me this man as perverting the people, and lo, I before you having examined, found in this man no fault in those things ye bring forward against him;</p>

<p><a id="c23_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> no, nor yet Herod, for I sent you back unto him, and lo, nothing worthy of death is having been done by him;</p>

<p><a id="c23_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> having chastised, therefore, I will release him,'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> for it was necessary for him to release to them one at every feast,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and they cried out--the whole multitude--saying, `Away with this one, and release to us Barabbas,'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> who had been, because of a certain sedition made in the city, and murder, cast into prison.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Pilate again then--wishing to release Jesus--called to them,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> but they were calling out, saying, `Crucify, crucify him.'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And he a third time said unto them, `Why, what evil did he? no cause of death did I find in him; having chastised him, then, I will release [him].'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And they were pressing with loud voices asking him to be crucified, and their voices, and those of the chief priests, were prevailing,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and Pilate gave judgment for their request being done,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and he released him who because of sedition and murder hath been cast into the prison, whom they were asking, and Jesus he gave up to their will.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And as they led him away, having taken hold on Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the field, they put on him the cross, to bear [it] behind Jesus.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And there was following him a great multitude of the people, and of women, who also were beating themselves and lamenting him,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and Jesus having turned unto them, said, `Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but for yourselves weep ye, and for your children;</p>

<p><a id="c23_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> for, lo, days do come, in which they shall say, Happy the barren, and wombs that did not bare, and paps that did not give suck;</p>

<p><a id="c23_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> then they shall begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us; --</p>

<p><a id="c23_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> for, if in the green tree they do these things--in the dry what may happen?'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And there were also others--two evil-doers--with him, to be put to death;</p>

<p><a id="c23_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> and when they came to the place that is called Skull, there they crucified him and the evil-doers, one on the right hand and one on the left.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And Jesus said, `Father, forgive them, for they have not known what they do;' and parting his garments they cast a lot.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And the people were standing, looking on, and the rulers also were sneering with them, saying, `Others he saved, let him save himself, if this be the Christ, the choice one of God.'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And mocking him also were the soldiers, coming near and offering vinegar to him,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> and saying, `If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And there was also a superscription written over him, in letters of Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew, `This is the King of the Jews.'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And one of the evil-doers who were hanged, was speaking evil of him, saying, `If thou be the Christ, save thyself and us.'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And the other answering, was rebuking him, saying, `Dost thou not even fear God, that thou art in the same judgment?</p>

<p><a id="c23_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> and we indeed righteously, for things worthy of what we did we receive back, but this one did nothing out of place;'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> and he said to Jesus, `Remember me, lord, when thou mayest come in thy reign;'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> and Jesus said to him, `Verily I say to thee, To-day with me thou shalt be in the paradise.'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> And it was, as it were, the sixth hour, and darkness came over all the land till the ninth hour,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> and the sun was darkened, and the vail of the sanctuary was rent in the midst,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> and having cried with a loud voice, Jesus said, `Father, to Thy hands I commit my spirit;' and these things having said, he breathed forth the spirit.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> And the centurion having seen what was done, did glorify God, saying, `Really this man was righteous;'</p>

<p><a id="c23_v48"></a><span class="vn">48</span> and all the multitudes who were come together to this sight, beholding the things that came to pass, smiting their breasts did turn back;</p>

<p><a id="c23_v49"></a><span class="vn">49</span> and all his acquaintances stood afar off, and women who did follow him from Galilee, beholding these things.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v50"></a><span class="vn">50</span> And lo, a man, by name Joseph, being a counsellor, a man good and righteous,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v51"></a><span class="vn">51</span> --he was not consenting to their counsel and deed--from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself was expecting the reign of God,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v52"></a><span class="vn">52</span> he, having gone near to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v53"></a><span class="vn">53</span> and having taken it down, he wrapped it in fine linen, and placed it in a tomb hewn out, where no one was yet laid.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v54"></a><span class="vn">54</span> And the day was a preparation, and sabbath was approaching,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v55"></a><span class="vn">55</span> and the women also who have come with him out of Galilee having followed after, beheld the tomb, and how his body was placed,</p>

<p><a id="c23_v56"></a><span class="vn">56</span> and having turned back, they made ready spices and ointments, and on the sabbath, indeed, they rested, according to the command.</p>
