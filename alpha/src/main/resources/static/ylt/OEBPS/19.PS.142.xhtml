<h2>Psalms 142</h2>

<p><a id="c142_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> An Instruction of David, a Prayer when he is in the cave. My voice [is] unto Jehovah, I cry, My voice [is] unto Jehovah, I entreat grace.</p>

<p><a id="c142_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I pour forth before Him my meditation, My distress before Him I declare.</p>

<p><a id="c142_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> When my spirit hath been feeble in me, Then Thou hast known my path; In the way [in] which I walk, They have hid a snare for me.</p>

<p><a id="c142_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Looking on the right hand--and seeing, And I have none recognizing; Perished hath refuge from me, There is none inquiring for my soul.</p>

<p><a id="c142_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I have cried unto thee, O Jehovah, I have said, `Thou [art] my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.'</p>

<p><a id="c142_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Attend Thou unto my loud cry, For I have become very low, Deliver Thou me from my pursuers, For they have been stronger than I.</p>

<p><a id="c142_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Bring forth from prison my soul to confess Thy name, The righteous do compass me about, When Thou conferrest benefits upon me!</p>
