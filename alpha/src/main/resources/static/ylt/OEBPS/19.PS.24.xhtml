<h2>Psalms 24</h2>

<p><a id="c24_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of David. To Jehovah [is] the earth and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For He on the seas hath founded it, And on the floods He doth establish it.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Who goeth up into the hill of Jehovah? And who riseth up in His holy place?</p>

<p><a id="c24_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The clean of hands, and pure of heart, Who hath not lifted up to vanity his soul, Nor hath sworn to deceit.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He beareth away a blessing from Jehovah, Righteousness from the God of his salvation.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> This [is] a generation of those seeking Him. Seeking Thy face, O Jacob! Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!</p>

<p><a id="c24_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Who [is] this--`the king of glory?' Jehovah--strong and mighty, Jehovah, the mighty in battle.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!</p>

<p><a id="c24_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Who [is] He--this `king of glory?' Jehovah of hosts--He [is] the king of glory! Selah.</p>
