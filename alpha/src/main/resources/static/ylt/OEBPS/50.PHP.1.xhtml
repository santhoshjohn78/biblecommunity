<h2>Philippians 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with overseers and ministrants;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I give thanks to my God upon all the remembrance of you,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> always, in every supplication of mine for you all, with joy making the supplication,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> for your contribution to the good news from the first day till now,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> having been confident of this very thing, that He who did begin in you a good work, will perform [it] till a day of Jesus Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> according as it is righteous for me to think this in behalf of you all, because of my having you in the heart, both in my bonds, and [in] the defence and confirmation of the good news, all of you being fellow-partakers with me of grace.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and this I pray, that your love yet more and more may abound in full knowledge, and all judgment,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for your proving the things that differ, that ye may be pure and offenceless--to a day of Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> being filled with the fruit of righteousness, that [is] through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things concerning me, rather to an advancement of the good news have come,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the whole praetorium, and to the other places--all,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and the greater part of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence by my bonds, are more abundantly bold--fearlessly to speak the word.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Certain, indeed, even through envy and contention, and certain also through good-will, do preach the Christ;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> the one, indeed, of rivalry the Christ do proclaim, not purely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and the other out of love, having known that for defence of the good news I am set:</p>

<p><a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> what then? in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed-- and in this I rejoice, yea, and shall rejoice.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For I have known that this shall fall out to me for salvation, through your supplication, and the supply of the Spirit of Christ Jesus,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, and in all freedom, as always, also now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> for to me to live [is] Christ, and to die gain.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And if to live in the flesh [is] to me a fruit of work, then what shall I choose? I know not;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> for I am pressed by the two, having the desire to depart, and to be with Christ, for it is far better,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and of this being persuaded, I have known that I shall remain and continue with you all, to your advancement and joy of the faith,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence again to you.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Only worthily of the good news of the Christ conduct ye yourselves, that, whether having come and seen you, whether being absent I may hear of the things concerning you, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul, striving togetherfor the faith of the good news,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and not terrified in anything by those opposing, which to them indeed is a token of destruction, and to you of salvation, and that from God;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> because to you it was granted, on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also on behalf of him to suffer;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> the same conflict having, such as ye saw in me, and now hear of in me.</p>
