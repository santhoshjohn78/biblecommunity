<h2>Numbers 9</h2>

<p><a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, in the wilderness of Sinai, in the second year of their going out of the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Also, the sons of Israel prepare the passover in its appointed season;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> in the fourteenth day of this month between the evenings ye prepare it in its appointed season; according to all its statutes, and according to all its ordinances ye prepare it.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Moses speaketh unto the sons of Israel to prepare the passover,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and they prepare the passover in the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month, between the evenings, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses, so have the sons of Israel done.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And there are men who have been defiled by the body of a man, and they have not been able to prepare the passover on that day, and they come near before Moses, and before Aaron, on that day,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and those men say unto him, `We are defiled by the body of a man; why are we withheld so as not to bring near the offering of Jehovah in its appointed season, in the midst of the sons of Israel?'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Moses saith unto them, `Stand ye, and I hear what Jehovah hath commanded concerning you.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Though any man is unclean by a body or in a distant journey (of you or of your generations), yet he hath prepared a passover to Jehovah;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> in the second month, on the fourteenth day, between the evenings they prepare it; with unleavened and bitter things they eat it;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> they do not leave of till morning; and a bone they do not break in it: according to all the statute of the passover they prepare it.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> `And the man who is clean, and hath not been on a journey, and hath ceased to prepare the passover, even that person hath been cut off from his people; because the offering of Jehovah he hath not brought near, in its appointed season, that man doth bear his sin.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> `And when a sojourner sojourneth with you, then he hath prepared a passover to Jehovah, according to the statute of the passover, and according to its ordinance, so he doth; one statute is to you, even to a sojourner, and to a native of the land.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And in the day of the raising up of the tabernacle hath the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony; and in the evening there is on the tabernacle as an appearance of fire till morning;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> so it is continually; the cloud covereth it, also the appearance of fire by night.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And according to the going up of the cloud from off the tent and afterwards do the sons of Israel journey; and in the place where the cloud doth tabernacle, there do the sons of Israel encamp;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> by the command of Jehovah the sons of Israel journey, and by the command of Jehovah they encamp; all the days that the cloud doth tabernacle over the tabernacle they encamp.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And in the cloud prolonging itself over the tabernacle many days, then have the sons of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and journey not,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and so when the cloud is a number of days over the tabernacle; by the command of Jehovah they encamp, and by the command of Jehovah they journey.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And so when the cloud is from evening till morning, when the cloud hath gone up in the morning, then they have journeyed; whether by day or by night, when the cloud hath gone up, then they have journeyed.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Whether two days, or a month, or days, in the cloud prolonging itself over the tabernacle, to tabernacle over it, the sons of Israel encamp, and journey not; and in its being lifted up they journey;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> by the command of Jehovah they encamp, and by the command of Jehovah they journey; the charge of Jehovah they have kept, by the command of Jehovah in the hand of Moses.</p>
