<h2>2 Corinthians 13</h2>

<p><a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> This third time do I come unto you; on the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every saying be established;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I have said before, and I say [it] before, as being present, the second time, and being absent, now, do I write to those having sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> since a proof ye seek of the Christ speaking in me, who to you is not infirm, but is powerful in you,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> for even if he was crucified from infirmity, yet he doth live from the power of God; for we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him from the power of God toward you.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Your own selves try ye, if ye are in the faith; your own selves prove ye; do ye not know your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, if ye be not in some respect disapproved of?</p>

<p><a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and I hope that ye shall know that we--we are not disapproved of;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and I pray before God that ye do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is right, and we may be as disapproved;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> for we are not able to do anything against the truth, but for the truth;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for we rejoice when we may be infirm, and ye may be powerful; and this also we pray for--your perfection!</p>

<p><a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> because of this, these things--being absent--I write, that being present, I may not treat [any] sharply, according to the authority that the Lord did give me for building up, and not for casting down.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Henceforth, brethren, rejoice; be made perfect, be comforted, be of the same mind, be at peace, and the God of the love and peace shall be with you;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> salute one another in an holy kiss;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> salute you do all the saints;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, [is] with you all! Amen.</p>
