<h2>Psalms 114</h2>

<p><a id="c114_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In the going out of Israel from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a strange people,</p>

<p><a id="c114_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Judah became His sanctuary, Israel his dominion.</p>

<p><a id="c114_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The sea hath seen, and fleeth, The Jordan turneth backward.</p>

<p><a id="c114_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The mountains have skipped as rams, Heights as sons of a flock.</p>

<p><a id="c114_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> What--to thee, O sea, that thou fleest? O Jordan, thou turnest back!</p>

<p><a id="c114_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> O mountains, ye skip as rams! O heights, as sons of a flock!</p>

<p><a id="c114_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> From before the Lord be afraid, O earth, From before the God of Jacob,</p>

<p><a id="c114_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He is turning the rock to a pool of waters, The flint to a fountain of waters!</p>
