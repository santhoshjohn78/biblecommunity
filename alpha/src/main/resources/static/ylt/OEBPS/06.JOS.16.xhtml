<h2>Joshua 16</h2>

<p><a id="c16_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the lot for the sons of Joseph goeth out from Jordan [by] Jericho, to the waters of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness going up from Jericho in the hill-country of Beth-El,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and hath gone out from Beth-El to Luz, and passed over unto the border of Archi [to] Ataroth,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and gone down westward unto the border of Japhleti, unto the border of Beth-Horon the lower, and unto Gezer, and its outgoings have been at the sea.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the sons of Joseph--Manasseh and Ephraim--inherit.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the border of the sons of Ephraim is by their families; and the border of their inheritance is on the east, Atroth-Addar unto Beth-Horon the upper;</p>

<p><a id="c16_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and the border hath gone out at the sea, to Michmethah on the north, and the border hath gone round eastward [to] Taanath-Shiloh, and passed over it eastward to Janohah,</p>

<p><a id="c16_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and gone down from Janohah [to] Ataroth, and to Naarath, and touched against Jericho, and gone out at the Jordan.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> From Tappuah the border goeth westward unto the brook of Kanah, and its outgoings have been at the sea: this [is] the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, for their families.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the separate cities of the sons of Ephraim [are] in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities and their villages;</p>

<p><a id="c16_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and they have not dispossessed the Canaanite who is dwelling in Gezer, and the Canaanite dwelleth in the midst of Ephraim unto this day, and is to tribute--a servant.</p>
