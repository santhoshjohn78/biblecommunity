<h2>2 Corinthians 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Do we begin again to recommend ourselves, except we need, as some, letters of recommendation unto you, or from you?</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> our letter ye are, having been written in our hearts, known and read by all men,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> manifested that ye are a letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in the tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and such trust we have through the Christ toward God,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything, as of ourselves, but our sufficiency [is] of God,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> who also made us sufficient [to be] ministrants of a new covenant, not of letter, but of spirit; for the letter doth kill, and the spirit doth make alive.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and if the ministration of the death, in letters, engraved in stones, came in glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to look stedfastly to the face of Moses, because of the glory of his face--which was being made useless,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> how shall the ministration of the Spirit not be more in glory?</p>

<p><a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for if the ministration of the condemnation [is] glory, much more doth the ministration of the righteousness abound in glory;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for also even that which hath been glorious, hath not been glorious--in this respect, because of the superior glory;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> for if that which is being made useless [is] through glory, much more that which is remaining [is] in glory.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Having, then, such hope, we use much freedom of speech,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and [are] not as Moses, who was putting a vail upon his own face, for the sons of Israel not stedfastly to look to the end of that which is being made useless,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> but their minds were hardened, for unto this day the same vail at the reading of the Old Covenant doth remain unwithdrawn--which in Christ is being made useless--</p>

<p><a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> but till to-day, when Moses is read, a vail upon their heart doth lie,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and whenever they may turn unto the Lord, the vail is taken away.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and we all, with unvailed face, the glory of the Lord beholding in a mirror, to the same image are being transformed, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
