<h2>Psalms 112</h2>

<p><a id="c112_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise ye Jah! O the happiness of one fearing Jehovah, In His commands he hath delighted greatly.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Mighty in the earth is his seed, The generation of the upright is blessed.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Wealth and riches [are] in his house, And his righteousness is standing for ever.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Light hath risen in darkness to the upright, Gracious, and merciful, and righteous.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Good [is] the man--gracious and lending, He sustaineth his matters in judgment.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For--to the age he is not moved; For a memorial age-during is the righteous.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Of an evil report he is not afraid, Prepared is His heart, confident in Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Sustained is his heart--he feareth not, Till that he look on his adversaries.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He hath scattered--hath given to the needy, His righteousness is standing for ever, His horn is exalted with honour.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The wicked seeth, and hath been angry, His teeth he gnasheth, and hath melted, The desire of the wicked doth perish!</p>
