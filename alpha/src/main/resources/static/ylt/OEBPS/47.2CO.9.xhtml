<h2>2 Corinthians 9</h2>

<p><a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For, indeed, concerning the ministration that [is] for the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> for I have known your readiness of mind, which in your behalf I boast of to Macedonians, that Achaia hath been prepared a year ago, and the zeal of you did stir up the more part,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and I sent the brethren, that our boasting on your behalf may not be made vain in this respect; that, according as I said, ye may be ready,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> lest if Macedonians may come with me, and find you unprepared, we--we may be put to shame (that we say not--ye) in this same confidence of boasting.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Necessary, therefore, I thought [it] to exhort the brethren, that they may go before to you, and may make up before your formerly announced blessing, that this be ready, as a blessing, and not as covetousness.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And this: He who is sowing sparingly, sparingly also shall reap; and he who is sowing in blessings, in blessings also shall reap;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> each one, according as he doth purpose in heart, not out of sorrow or out of necessity, for a cheerful giver doth God love,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and God [is] able all grace to cause to abound to you, that in every thing always all sufficiency having, ye may abound to every good work,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> (according as it hath been written, `He dispersed abroad, he gave to the poor, his righteousness doth remain to the age,')</p>

<p><a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and may He who is supplying seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> in every thing being enriched to all liberality, which doth work through us thanksgiving to God,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> because the ministration of this service not only is supplying the wants of the saints, but is also abounding through many thanksgivings to God,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> through the proof of this ministration glorifying God for the subjection of your confession to the good news of the Christ, and [for] the liberality of the fellowship to them and to all,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and by their supplication in your behalf, longing after you because of the exceeding grace of God upon you;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> thanks also to God for His unspeakable gift!</p>
