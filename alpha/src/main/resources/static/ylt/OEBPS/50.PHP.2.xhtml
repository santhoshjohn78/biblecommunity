<h2>Philippians 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> If, then, any exhortation [is] in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> fulfil ye my joy, that ye may mind the same thing--having the same love--of one soul--minding the one thing,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> nothing in rivalry or vain-glory, but in humility of mind one another counting more excellent than yourselves--</p>

<p><a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> each not to your own look ye, but each also to the things of others.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For, let this mind be in you that [is] also in Christ Jesus,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> who, being in the form of God, thought [it] not robbery to be equal to God,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> but did empty himself, the form of a servant having taken, in the likeness of men having been made,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and in fashion having been found as a man, he humbled himself, having become obedient unto death--death even of a cross,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> wherefore, also, God did highly exalt him, and gave to him a name that [is] above every name,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> that in the name of Jesus every knee may bow--of heavenlies, and earthlies, and what are under the earth--</p>

<p><a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> So that, my beloved, as ye always obey, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, with fear and trembling your own salvation work out,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> for God it is who is working in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> All things do without murmurings and reasonings,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God, unblemished in the midst of a generation crooked and perverse, among whom ye do appear as luminaries in the world,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> the word of life holding forth, for rejoicing to me in regard to a day of Christ, that not in vain did I run, nor in vain did I labour;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> but if also I am poured forth upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and joy with you all,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> because of this do ye also rejoice and joy with me.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And I hope, in the Lord Jesus, Timotheus to send quickly to you, that I also may be of good spirit, having known the things concerning you,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> for I have no one like-minded, who sincerely for the things concerning you will care,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> for the whole seek their own things, not the things of the Christ Jesus,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and the proof of him ye know, that as a child [serveth] a father, with me he did serve in regard to the good news;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> him, indeed, therefore, I hope to send, when I may see through the things concerning me--immediately;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall quickly come.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And I thought [it] necessary Epaphroditus--my brother, and fellow-workman, and fellow-soldier, and your apostle and servant to my need--to send unto you,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> seeing he was longing after you all, and in heaviness, because ye heard that he ailed,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> for he also ailed nigh to death, but God did deal kindly with him, and not with him only, but also with me, that sorrow upon sorrow I might not have.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> The more eagerly, therefore, I did send him, that having seen him again ye may rejoice, and I may be the less sorrowful;</p>

<p><a id="c2_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> receive him, therefore, in the Lord, with all joy, and hold such in honour,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> because on account of the work of the Christ he drew near to death, having hazarded the life that he might fill up your deficiency of service unto me.</p>
