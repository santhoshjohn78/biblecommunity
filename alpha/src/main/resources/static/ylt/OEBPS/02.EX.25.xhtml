<h2>Exodus 25</h2>

<p><a id="c25_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c25_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and they take for Me a heave-offering; from every man whose heart impelleth him ye do take My heave-offering.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> `And this [is] the heave-offering which ye take from them; gold, and silver, and brass,</p>

<p><a id="c25_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and linen, and goats' [hair],</p>

<p><a id="c25_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and rams' skins made red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,</p>

<p><a id="c25_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the perfume of the spices,</p>

<p><a id="c25_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> shoham stones, and stones for setting for an ephod, and for a breastplate.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> `And they have made for Me a sanctuary, and I have tabernacled in their midst;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> according to all that which I am shewing thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all its vessels, even so ye do make [it].</p>

<p><a id="c25_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> `And they have made an ark of shittim wood; two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and thou hast overlaid it [with] pure gold, within and without thou dost overlay it, and thou hast made on it a ring of gold round about.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> `And thou hast cast for it four rings of gold, and hast put [them] on its four feet, even two rings on its one side, and two rings on its second side;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and thou hast made staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them [with] gold,</p>

<p><a id="c25_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and hast brought the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark by them,</p>

<p><a id="c25_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> in the rings of the ark are the staves, they are not turned aside from it;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and thou hast put unto the ark the testimony which I give unto thee.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> `And thou hast made a mercy-seat of pure gold, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and thou hast made two cherubs of gold, beaten work dost thou make them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and make thou one cherub at the end on this side, and one cherub at the end on that; at the mercy-seat ye do make the cherubs on its two ends.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> `And the cherubs have been spreading out wings on high, covering the mercy-seat over with their wings, and their faces [are] one towards another--towards the mercy-seat are the faces of the cherubs.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> `And thou hast put the mercy-seat on the ark above, and unto the ark thou dost put the testimony which I give unto thee;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and I have met with thee there, and have spoken with thee from off the mercy-seat (from between the two cherubs, which [are] on the ark of the testimony) all that which I command thee concerning the sons of Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> `And thou hast made a table of shittim wood, two cubits its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height,</p>

<p><a id="c25_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and hast overlaid it [with] pure gold, and hast made for it a crown of gold round about,</p>

<p><a id="c25_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and hast made for it a border of a handbreadth round about, and hast made a crown of gold to its border round about.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> `And thou hast made to it four rings of gold, and hast put the rings on the four corners, which [are] to its four feet;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> over-against the border are the rings for places for staves to bear the table;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and thou hast made the staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them with gold, and the table hath been borne with them;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and thou hast made its dishes, and its bowls, and its covers, and its cups, with which they pour out; of pure gold thou dost make them;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and thou hast put on the table bread of the presence before Me continually.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> `And thou hast made a candlestick of pure gold, of beaten work is the candlestick made; its base, and its branch, its calyxes, its knops, and its flowers are of the same;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and six branches are coming out of its sides, three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the second side;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> three calyxes made like almonds in the one branch, a knop and a flower, and three calyxes made like almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; so for the six branches which are coming out from the candlestick.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> `And in the candlestick [are] four calyxes made like almonds, its knops and its flowers;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, [are] to the six branches which are coming out of the candlestick;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> their knops and their branches are of the same, all of it one beaten work of pure gold;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> and thou hast made its seven lamps, and [one] hath caused its lights to go up, and it hath given light over-against its front.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> `And its snuffers and its snuff dishes [are] of pure gold;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> of a talent of pure gold he doth make it, with all these vessels.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And see thou and do [them] by their pattern which thou art shewn in the mount.</p>
