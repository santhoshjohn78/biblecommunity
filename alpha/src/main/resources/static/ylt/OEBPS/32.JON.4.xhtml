<h2>Jonah 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it is grievous unto Jonah--a great evil--and he is displeased at it;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and he prayeth unto Jehovah, and he saith, `I pray Thee, O Jehovah, is not this my word while I was in mine own land--therefore I was beforehand to flee to Tarshish--that I have known that Thou [art] a God, gracious and merciful, slow to anger,and abundant in kindness, and repenting of evil?</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And now, O Jehovah, take, I pray Thee, my soul from me, for better [is] my death than my life.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Jehovah saith, `Is doing good displeasing to thee?'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Jonah goeth forth from the city, and sitteth on the east of the city, and maketh to himself there a booth, and sitteth under it in the shade, till that he seeth what is in the city.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Jehovah God appointeth a gourd, and causeth it to come up over Jonah, to be a shade over his head, to give deliverance to him from his affliction, and Jonah rejoiceth because of the gourd [with] great joy.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And God appointeth a worm at the going up of the dawn on the morrow, and it smiteth the gourd, and it drieth up.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And it cometh to pass, about the rising of the sun, that God appointeth a cutting east wind, and the sun smiteth on the head of Jonah, and he wrappeth himself up, and asketh his soul to die, and saith, `Better [is] my death than my life.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And God saith unto Jonah: `Is doing good displeasing to thee, because of the gourd?' and he saith, `To do good is displeasing to me--unto death.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Jehovah saith, `Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou didst not labour, neither didst thou nourish it, which a son of a night was, and a son of a night perished,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and I--have not I pity on Nineveh, the great city, in which there are more than twelve myriads of human beings, who have not known between their right hand and their left--and much cattle!'</p>
