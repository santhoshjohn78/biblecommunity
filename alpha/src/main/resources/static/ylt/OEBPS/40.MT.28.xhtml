<h2>Matthew 28</h2>

<p><a id="c28_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And on the eve of the sabbaths, at the dawn, toward the first of the sabbaths, came Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre,</p>

<p><a id="c28_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and lo, there came a great earthquake, for a messenger of the Lord, having come down out of heaven, having come, did roll away the stone from the door, and was sitting upon it,</p>

<p><a id="c28_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and his countenance was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow,</p>

<p><a id="c28_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and from the fear of him did the keepers shake, and they became as dead men.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the messenger answering said to the women, `Fear not ye, for I have known that Jesus, who hath been crucified, ye seek;</p>

<p><a id="c28_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> he is not here, for he rose, as he said; come, see the place where the Lord was lying;</p>

<p><a id="c28_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and having gone quickly, say ye to his disciples, that he rose from the dead; and lo, he doth go before you to Galilee, there ye shall see him; lo, I have told you.'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And having gone forth quickly from the tomb, with fear and great joy, they ran to tell to his disciples;</p>

<p><a id="c28_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and as they were going to tell to his disciples, then lo, Jesus met them, saying, `Hail!' and they having come near, laid hold of his feet, and did bow to him.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Then saith Jesus to them, `Fear ye not, go away, tell to my brethren that they may go away to Galilee, and there they shall see me.'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And while they are going on, lo, certain of the watch having come to the city, told to the chief priests all the things that happened,</p>

<p><a id="c28_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and having been gathered together with the elders, counsel also having taken, they gave much money to the soldiers,</p>

<p><a id="c28_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> saying, `Say ye, that his disciples having come by night, stole him--we being asleep;</p>

<p><a id="c28_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and if this be heard by the governor, we will persuade him, and you keep free from anxiety.'</p>

<p><a id="c28_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And they, having received the money, did as they were taught, and this account was spread abroad among Jews till this day.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mount where Jesus appointed them,</p>

<p><a id="c28_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and having seen him, they bowed to him, but some did waver.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And having come near, Jesus spake to them, saying, `Given to me was all authority in heaven and on earth;</p>

<p><a id="c28_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> having gone, then, disciple all the nations, (baptizing them--to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,</p>

<p><a id="c28_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> teaching them to observe all, whatever I did command you,) and lo, I am with you all the days--till the full end of the age.'</p>
