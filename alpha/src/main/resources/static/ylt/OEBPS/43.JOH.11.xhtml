<h2>John 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And there was a certain one ailing, Lazarus, from Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister--</p>

<p><a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and it was Mary who did anoint the Lord with ointment, and did wipe his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ailing--</p>

<p><a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> therefore sent the sisters unto him, saying, `Sir, lo, he whom thou dost love is ailing;'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and Jesus having heard, said, `This ailment is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Jesus was loving Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> when, therefore, he heard that he is ailing, then indeed he remained in the place in which he was two days,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> then after this, he saith to the disciples, `We may go to Judea again;'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> the disciples say to him, `Rabbi, now were the Jews seeking to stone thee, and again thou dost go thither!'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Jesus answered, `Are there not twelve hours in the day? if any one may walk in the day, he doth not stumble, because the light of this world he doth see;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and if any one may walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> These things he said, and after this he saith to them, `Lazarus our friend hath fallen asleep, but I go on that I may awake him;'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> therefore said his disciples, `Sir, if he hath fallen asleep, he will be saved;'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> but Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought that about the repose of sleep he speaketh.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Then, therefore, Jesus said to them freely, `Lazarus hath died;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and I rejoice, for your sake, (that ye may believe,) that I was not there; but we may go to him;'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> therefore said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to the fellow-disciples, `We may go-- we also, that we may die with him,'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Jesus, therefore, having come, found him having been four days already in the tomb.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and many of the Jews had come unto Martha and Mary, that they might comfort them concerning their brother;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Martha, therefore, when she heard that Jesus doth come, met him, and Mary kept sitting in the house.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Martha, therefore, said unto Jesus, `Sir, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> but even now, I have known that whatever thou mayest ask of God, God will give to thee;'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Jesus saith to her, `Thy brother shall rise again.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Martha saith to him, `I have known that he will rise again, in the rising again in the last day;'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Jesus said to her, `I am the rising again, and the life; he who is believing in me, even if he may die, shall live;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and every one who is living and believing in me shall not die--to the age;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> believest thou this?' she saith to him, `Yes, sir, I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming to the world.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And these things having said, she went away, and called Mary her sister privately, saying, `The Teacher is present, and doth call thee;'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> she, when she heard, riseth up quickly, and doth come to him;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was in the place where Martha met him;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> the Jews, therefore, who were with her in the house, and were comforting her, having seen Mary that she rose up quickly and went forth, followed her, saying--`She doth go away to the tomb, that she may weep there.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, having seen him, fell at his feet, saying to him, `Sir, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died;'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, did groan in the spirit, and troubled himself, and he said,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> `Where have ye laid him?' they say to him, `Sir, come and see;'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> Jesus wept.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> The Jews, therefore, said, `Lo, how he was loving him!'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> and certain of them said, `Was not this one, who did open the eyes of the blind man, able to cause that also this one might not have died?'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> Jesus, therefore, again groaning in himself, cometh to the tomb, and it was a cave, and a stone was lying upon it,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> Jesus saith, `Take ye away the stone;' the sister of him who hath died--Martha--saith to him, `Sir, already he stinketh, for he is four days dead;'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> Jesus saith to her, `Said I not to thee, that if thou mayest believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> They took away, therefore, the stone where the dead was laid, and Jesus lifted his eyes upwards, and said, `Father, I thank Thee, that Thou didst hear me;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> and I knew that Thou always dost hear me, but, because of the multitude that is standing by, I said [it], that they may believe that Thou didst send me.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> And these things saying, with a loud voice he cried out, `Lazarus, come forth;'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> and he who died came forth, being bound feet and hands with grave-clothes, and his visage with a napkin was bound about; Jesus saith to them, `Loose him, and suffer to go.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> Many, therefore, of the Jews who came unto Mary, and beheld what Jesus did, believed in him;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> but certain of them went away unto the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus did;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> the chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered together a sanhedrim, and said, `What may we do? because this man doth many signs?</p>

<p><a id="c11_v48"></a><span class="vn">48</span> if we may let him alone thus, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and will take away both our place and nation.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v49"></a><span class="vn">49</span> and a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being chief priest of that year, said to them, `Ye have not known anything,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v50"></a><span class="vn">50</span> nor reason that it is good for us that one man may die for the people, and not the whole nation perish.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v51"></a><span class="vn">51</span> And this he said not of himself, but being chief priest of that year, he did prophesy that Jesus was about to die for the nation,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v52"></a><span class="vn">52</span> and not for the nation only, but that also the children of God, who have been scattered abroad, he may gather together into one.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v53"></a><span class="vn">53</span> From that day, therefore, they took counsel together that they may kill him;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v54"></a><span class="vn">54</span> Jesus, therefore, was no more freely walking among the Jews, but went away thence to the region nigh the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he tarried with his disciples.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v55"></a><span class="vn">55</span> And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they might purify themselves;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v56"></a><span class="vn">56</span> they were seeking, therefore, Jesus, and said one with another, standing in the temple, `What doth appear to you--that he may not come to the feast?'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v57"></a><span class="vn">57</span> and both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if any one may know where he is, he may shew [it], so that they may seize him.</p>
