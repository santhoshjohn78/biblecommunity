<h2>Leviticus 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah calleth unto Moses, and speaketh unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, Any man of you when he doth bring near an offering to Jehovah, out of the cattle--out of the herd, or out of the flock--ye do bring near your offering.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> `If his offering [is] a burnt-offering out of the herd--a male, a perfect one, he doth bring near, unto the opening of the tent of meeting he doth bring it near, at his pleasure, before Jehovah;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and he hath laid his hand on the head of the burnt-offering, and it hath been accepted for him to make atonement for him;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and he hath slaughtered the son of the herd before Jehovah; and sons of Aaron, the priests, have brought the blood near, and sprinkled the blood on the altar round about, which [is] at the opening of the tent of meeting.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> `And he hath stripped the burnt-offering, and hath cut it into its pieces;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and the sons of Aaron the priest have put fire on the altar, and arranged wood on the fire;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and sons of Aaron, the priests, have arranged the pieces, with the head and the fat, on the wood, which [is] on the fire, which [is] on the altar;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and its inwards and its legs he doth wash with water; and the priest hath made perfume with the whole on the altar, a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> `And if his offering [is] out of the flock--out of the sheep or out of the goats--for a burnt-offering, a male, a perfect one, he doth bring near,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and he hath slaughtered it by the side of the altar northward, before Jehovah; and sons of Aaron, the priests, have sprinkled its blood on the altar round about;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and he hath cut it into its pieces, and its head and its fat, and the priest hath arranged them on the wood, which [is] on the fire, which [is] on the altar;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and the inwards and the legs he doth wash with water, and the priest hath brought the whole near, and hath made perfume on the altar; it [is] a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> `And if his offering [is] a burnt-offering out of the fowl to Jehovah, than he hath brought near his offering out of the turtle-doves or out of the young pigeons,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and the priest hath brought it near unto the altar, and hath wrung off its head, and hath made perfume on the altar, and its blood hath been wrung out by the side of the altar;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and he hath turned aside its crop with its feathers, and hath cast it near the altar, eastward, unto the place of ashes;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and he hath cleaved it with its wings (he doth not separate [it]), and the priest hath made it a perfume on the altar, on the wood, which [is] on the fire; it [is] a burnt-offering, a fireoffering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p>
