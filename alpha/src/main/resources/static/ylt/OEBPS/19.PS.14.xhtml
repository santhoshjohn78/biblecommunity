<h2>Psalms 14</h2>

<p><a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To the Overseer. --By David. A fool hath said in his heart, `God is not;' They have done corruptly, They have done abominable actions, There is not a doer of good.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah from the heavens Hath looked on the sons of men, To see if there is a wise one--seeking God.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The whole have turned aside, Together they have been filthy: There is not a doer of good, not even one.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Have all working iniquity not known? Those consuming my people have eaten bread, Jehovah they have not called.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> There they have feared a fear, For God [is] in the generation of the righteous.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The counsel of the poor ye cause to stink, Because Jehovah [is] his refuge.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `Who doth give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When Jehovah doth turn back [To] a captivity of His people, Jacob doth rejoice--Israel is glad!</p>
