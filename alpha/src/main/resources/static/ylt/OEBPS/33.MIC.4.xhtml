<h2>Micah 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it hath come to pass, In the latter end of the days, The mount of the house of Jehovah Is established above the top of the mounts, And it hath been lifted up above the hills, And flowed unto it have peoples.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And gone have many nations and said, Come and we go up to the mount of Jehovah, And unto the house of the God of Jacob, And He doth teach us of His ways, And we do walk in His paths, For from Zion doth go forth a law, And a word of Jehovah fromJerusalem.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And He hath judged between many peoples, And given a decision to mighty nations afar off, They have beaten their swords to ploughshares, And their spears to pruning-hooks, Nation lifteth not up sword unto nation, Nor do they learn war any more.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And they have sat each under his vine, And under his fig-tree, And there is none troubling, For the mouth of Jehovah of Hosts hath spoken.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For all the peoples do walk, Each in the name of its god--and we, We do walk in the name of Jehovah our God, To the age and for ever.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> In that day--an affirmation of Jehovah, I do gather the halting one, And the driven away one I bring together, And she whom I have afflicted.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I have set the halting for a remnant, And the far-off for a mighty nation, And reigned hath Jehovah over them in mount Zion, From henceforth, and unto the age.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And thou, O tower of Eder, Fort of the daughter of Zion, unto thee it cometh, Yea, come in hath the former rule, The kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Now, why dost thou shout aloud? A king--is there none in thee? Hath thy counsellor perished, That taken hold of thee hath pain as a travailing woman?</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Be pained, and bring forth, O daughter of Zion, As a travailing woman, For now, thou goest forth from the city, And thou hast dwelt in the field, And thou hast gone unto Babylon, There thou art delivered, There redeem thee doth Jehovah from the hand of thine enemies.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And now, gathered against thee have been many nations, who are saying: `Let her be defiled, and our eyes look on Zion.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> They have not known the thoughts of Jehovah, Nor have they understood His counsel, For He hath gathered them as a sheaf [into] a threshing-floor.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Arise, and thresh, O daughter of Zion, For thy horn I make iron, And thy hoofs I make brass, And thou hast beaten small many peoples, And I have devoted to Jehovah their gain, And their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth!</p>
