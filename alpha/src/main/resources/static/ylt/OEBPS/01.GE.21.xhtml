<h2>Genesis 21</h2>

<p><a id="c21_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah hath looked after Sarah as He hath said, and Jehovah doth to Sarah as He hath spoken;</p>

<p><a id="c21_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and Sarah conceiveth, and beareth a son to Abraham, to his old age, at the appointed time that God hath spoken of with him;</p>

<p><a id="c21_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and Abraham calleth the name of his son who is born to him, whom Sarah hath born to him--Isaac;</p>

<p><a id="c21_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and Abraham circumciseth Isaac his son, [being] a son of eight days, as God hath commanded him.</p>

<p><a id="c21_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Abraham [is] a son of a hundred years in Isaac his son being born to him,</p>

<p><a id="c21_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and Sarah saith, `God hath made laughter for me; every one who is hearing laugheth for me.'</p>

<p><a id="c21_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> She saith also, `Who hath said to Abraham, Sarah hath suckled sons, that I have born a son for his old age?'</p>

<p><a id="c21_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the lad groweth, and is weaned, and Abraham maketh a great banquet in the day of Isaac's being weaned;</p>

<p><a id="c21_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and Sarah seeth the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she hath borne to Abraham, mocking,</p>

<p><a id="c21_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and she saith to Abraham, `Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this handmaid hath no possession with my son--with Isaac.'</p>

<p><a id="c21_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the thing is very wrong in the eyes of Abraham, for his son's sake;</p>

<p><a id="c21_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and God saith unto Abraham, `Let it not be wrong in thine eyes because of the youth, and because of thy handmaid: all that Sarah saith unto thee--hearken to her voice, for in Isaac is a seed called to thee.</p>

<p><a id="c21_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> As to the son of the handmaid also, for a nation I set him, because he [is] thy seed.'</p>

<p><a id="c21_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Abraham riseth early in the morning, and taketh bread, and a bottle of water, and giveth unto Hagar (placing [it] on her shoulder), also the lad, and sendeth her out; and she goeth on, and goeth astray in the wilderness of Beer-Sheba;</p>

<p><a id="c21_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and the water is consumed from the bottle, and she placeth the lad under one of the shrubs.</p>

<p><a id="c21_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And she goeth and sitteth by herself over-against, afar off, about a bow-shot, for she said, `Let me not look on the death of the lad;' and she sitteth over-against, and lifteth up her voice, and weepeth.</p>

<p><a id="c21_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And God heareth the voice of the youth; and the messenger of God calleth unto Hagar from the heavens, and saith to her, `What to thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath hearkened unto the voice of the youth where he [is];</p>

<p><a id="c21_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> rise, lift up the youth, and lay hold on him with thy hand, for for a great nation I set him.'</p>

<p><a id="c21_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And God openeth her eyes, and she seeth a well of water, and she goeth and filleth the bottle [with] water, and causeth the youth to drink;</p>

<p><a id="c21_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and God is with the youth, and he groweth, and dwelleth in the wilderness, and is an archer;</p>

<p><a id="c21_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and he dwelleth in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother taketh for him a wife from the land of Egypt.</p>

<p><a id="c21_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And it cometh to pass at that time that Abimelech speaketh--Phichol also, head of his host--unto Abraham, saying, `God [is] with thee in all that thou art doing;</p>

<p><a id="c21_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and now, swear to me by God here: thou dost not lie to me, or to my continuator, or to my successor; according to the kindness which I have done with thee thou dost with me, and with the land in which thou hast sojourned.'</p>

<p><a id="c21_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Abraham saith, `I--I do swear.'</p>

<p><a id="c21_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Abraham reasoned with Abimelech concerning the matter of a well of water which Abimelech's servants have taken violently away,</p>

<p><a id="c21_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and Abimelech saith, `I have not known who hath done this thing, and even thou didst not declare to me, and I also, I have not heard save to-day.'</p>

<p><a id="c21_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And Abraham taketh sheep and oxen, and giveth to Abimelech, and they make, both of them, a covenant;</p>

<p><a id="c21_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and Abraham setteth seven Lambs of the flock by themselves.</p>

<p><a id="c21_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Abimelech saith unto Abraham, `What [are] they--these seven lambs which thou hast set by themselves?'</p>

<p><a id="c21_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And he saith, `For--the seven lambs thou dost accept from my hand, so that it becometh a witness for me that I have digged this well;'</p>

<p><a id="c21_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> therefore hath he called that place `Beer-Sheba,' for there have both of them sworn.</p>

<p><a id="c21_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And they make a covenant in Beer-Sheba, and Abimelech riseth--Phichol also, head of his host--and they turn back unto the land of the Philistines;</p>

<p><a id="c21_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> and [Abraham] planteth a tamarisk in Beer-Sheba, and preacheth there in the name of Jehovah, God age-during;</p>

<p><a id="c21_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> and Abraham sojourneth in the land of the Philistines many days.</p>
