<h2>Hebrews 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in all his house,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth build it,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all things did build [is] God,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and Moses indeed [was] stedfast in all his house, as an attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be spoken,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we hold fast.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Wherefore, (as the Holy Spirit saith, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear--</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and saw My works forty years;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My ways;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest--!')</p>

<p><a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> but exhort ye one another every day, while the To-day is called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> in its being said, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did come out of Egypt through Moses;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</p>

<p><a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe? --</p>

<p><a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</p>
