<h2>Psalms 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Why have nations tumultuously assembled? And do peoples meditate vanity?</p>

<p><a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Station themselves do kings of the earth, And princes have been united together, Against Jehovah, and against His Messiah:</p>

<p><a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> `Let us draw off Their cords, And cast from us Their thick bands.'</p>

<p><a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He who is sitting in the heavens doth laugh, The Lord doth mock at them.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Then doth He speak unto them in His anger, And in His wrath He doth trouble them:</p>

<p><a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> `And I--I have anointed My King, Upon Zion--My holy hill.'</p>

<p><a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I declare concerning a statute: Jehovah said unto me, `My Son Thou [art], I to-day have brought thee forth.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Ask of Me and I give nations--thy inheritance, And thy possession--the ends of earth.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Thou dost rule them with a sceptre of iron, As a vessel of a potter Thou dost crush them.'</p>

<p><a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And now, O kings, act wisely, Be instructed, O judges of earth,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Serve ye Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Kiss the Chosen One, lest He be angry, And ye lose the way, When His anger burneth but a little, O the happiness of all trusting in Him!</p>
