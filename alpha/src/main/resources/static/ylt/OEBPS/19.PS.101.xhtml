<h2>Psalms 101</h2>

<p><a id="c101_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of David. Kindness and judgment I sing, To Thee, O Jehovah, I sing praise.</p>

<p><a id="c101_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I act wisely in a perfect way, When dost Thou come in unto me? I walk habitually in the integrity of my heart, In the midst of my house.</p>

<p><a id="c101_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I set not before mine eyes a worthless thing, The work of those turning aside I have hated, It adhereth not to me.</p>

<p><a id="c101_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> A perverse heart turneth aside from me, Wickedness I know not.</p>

<p><a id="c101_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Whoso slandereth in secret his neighbour, Him I cut off, The high of eyes and proud of heart, him I endure not.</p>

<p><a id="c101_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Mine eyes are on the faithful of the land, To dwell with me, Whoso is walking in a perfect way, he serveth me.</p>

<p><a id="c101_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He dwelleth not in my house who is working deceit, Whoso is speaking lies Is not established before mine eyes.</p>

<p><a id="c101_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> At morning I cut off all the wicked of the land, To cut off from the city of Jehovah All the workers of iniquity!</p>
