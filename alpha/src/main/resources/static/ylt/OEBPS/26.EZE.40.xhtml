<h2>Ezekiel 40</h2>

<p><a id="c40_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In the twenty and fifth year of our removal, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in this self-same day hath a hand of Jehovah been upon me, and He bringeth me in thither;</p>

<p><a id="c40_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> in visions of God He hath brought me in unto the land of Israel, and causeth me to rest on a very high mountain, and upon it [is] as the frame of a city on the south.</p>

<p><a id="c40_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And He bringeth me in thither, and lo, a man, his appearance as the appearance of brass, and a thread of flax in his hand, and a measuring-reed, and he is standing at the gate,</p>

<p><a id="c40_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and the man speaketh unto me: `Son of man, see with thine eyes, And with thine ears hear, And set thy heart to all that I am shewing thee, For, in order to shew [it] thee, Thou hast been brought in hither, Declare all that thou art seeing tothe house of Israel.'</p>

<p><a id="c40_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And lo, a wall on the outside of the house all round about, and in the hand of the man a measuring-reed, six cubits by a cubit and a handbreadth, and he measureth the breadth of the building one reed, and the height one reed.</p>

<p><a id="c40_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he cometh in unto the gate whose front [is] eastward, and he goeth up by its steps, and he measureth the threshold of the gate one reed broad, even the one threshold one reed broad,</p>

<p><a id="c40_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and the little chamber one reed long and one reed broad, and between the little chambers five cubits, and the threshold of the gate, from the side of the porch of the gate from within, one reed.</p>

<p><a id="c40_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he measureth the porch of the gate from within one reed,</p>

<p><a id="c40_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and he measureth the porch of the gate eight cubits, and its posts two cubits, and the porch of the gates from within,</p>

<p><a id="c40_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and the little chambers of the gate eastward, three on this side, and three on that side; one measure [is] to them three, and one measure [is] to the posts, on this side and on that side.</p>

<p><a id="c40_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And he measureth the breadth of the opening of the gate ten cubits, the length of the gate thirteen cubits;</p>

<p><a id="c40_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and a border before the little chambers, one cubit, and one cubit [is] the border on this side, and the little chamber [is] six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.</p>

<p><a id="c40_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he measureth the gate from the roof of the [one] little chamber to the roof of another; the breadth twenty and five cubits, opening over-against opening.</p>

<p><a id="c40_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And he maketh the posts of sixty cubits, even unto the post of the court, the gate all round about;</p>

<p><a id="c40_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and by the front of the gate of the entrance, by the front of the porch of the inner gate, fifty cubits;</p>

<p><a id="c40_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and narrow windows [are] unto the little chambers, and unto their posts at the inside of the gate all round about--and so to the arches--and windows all round about [are] at the inside, and at the post [are] palm-trees.</p>

<p><a id="c40_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And he bringeth me in unto the outer court, and lo, chambers and a pavement made for the court all round about--thirty chambers on the pavement--</p>

<p><a id="c40_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and the pavement unto the side of the gates over-against the length of the gates [is] the lower pavement;</p>

<p><a id="c40_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and he measureth the breadth from before the lower gate, to the front of the inner court, on the outside, a hundred cubits, eastward and northward.</p>

<p><a id="c40_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> As to the gate of the outer court whose front [is] northward, he hath measured its length and its breadth;</p>

<p><a id="c40_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And the gate of the inner court [is] over-against the gate at the north and at the east; and he measureth from gate unto gate, a hundred cubits.</p>

<p><a id="c40_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And he causeth me to go southward, and lo, a gate southward, and he hath measured its posts and its arches according to these measures;</p>

<p><a id="c40_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and windows [are] to it and to its arches all round about, like these windows, fifty cubits the length, and the breadth five and twenty cubits;</p>
