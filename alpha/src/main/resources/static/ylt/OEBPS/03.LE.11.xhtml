<h2>Leviticus 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying unto them,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, This [is] the beast which ye do eat out of all the beasts which [are] on the earth:</p>

<p><a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> any dividing a hoof, and cleaving the cleft of the hoofs, bringing up the cud, among the beasts, it ye do eat.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> `Only, this ye do not eat--of those bringing up the cud, and of those dividing the hoof--the camel, though it is bringing up the cud, yet the hoof not dividing--it [is] unclean to you;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and the rabbit, though it is bringing up the cud, yet the hoof it divideth not--unclean it [is] to you;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and the hare, though it is bringing up the cud, yet the hoof hath not divided--unclean it [is] to you;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and the sow, though it is dividing the hoof, and cleaving the cleft of the hoof, yet the cud it bringeth not up--unclean it [is] to you.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> `Of their flesh ye do not eat, and against their carcase ye do not come--unclean they [are] to you.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> `This ye do eat of all which [are] in the waters; any one that hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the brooks, them ye do eat;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and any one that hath not fins and scales in the seas, and in the brooks, of any teeming creature of the waters, and of any creature which liveth, which [is] in the waters--an abomination they [are] to you;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> yea, an abomination they are to you; of their flesh ye do not eat, and their carcase ye abominate.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> `Any one that hath not fins and scales in the waters--an abomination it [is] to you.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> `And these ye do abominate of the fowl; they are not eaten, an abomination they [are]: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and the vulture, and the kite after its kind,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> every raven after its kind,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and the owl, and the night-hawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after its kind,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> `Every teeming creature which is flying, which is going on four--an abomination it [is] to you.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> `Only--this ye do eat of any teeming thing which is flying, which is going on four, which hath legs above its feet, to move with them on the earth;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> these of them ye do eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the beetle after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and every teeming thing which is flying, which hath four feet--an abomination it [is] to you.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> `And by these ye are made unclean, any one who is coming against their carcase is unclean till the evening;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and anyone who is lifting up [aught] of their carcase doth wash his garments, and hath been unclean till the evening: --</p>

<p><a id="c11_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> even every beast which is dividing the hoof, and is not cloven-footed, and the cud is not bringing up--unclean they [are] to you; any one who is coming against them is unclean.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> `And any one going on its paws, among all the beasts which are going on four-- unclean they [are] to you; any one who is coming against their carcase is unclean until the evening;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and he who is lifting up their carcase doth wash his garments, and hath been unclean until the evening--unclean they [are] to you.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> `And this [is] to you the unclean among the teeming things which are teeming on the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after its kind,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> these [are] the unclean to you among all which are teeming; any one who is coming against them in their death is unclean till the evening.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> `And anything on which any one of them falleth, in their death, is unclean, of any vessel of wood or garment or skin or sack, any vessel in which work is done is brought into water, and hath been unclean till the evening, then it hath been clean;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> and any earthen vessel, into the midst of which [any] one of them falleth, all that [is] in its midst is unclean, and it ye do break.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> `Of all the food which is eaten, that on which cometh [such] water, is unclean, and all drink which is drunk in any [such] vessel is unclean;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> and anything on which [any] of their carcase falleth is unclean (oven or double pots), it is broken down, unclean they [are], yea, unclean they are to you.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> `Only--a fountain or pit, a collection of water, is clean, but that which is coming against their carcase is unclean;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> and when [any] of their carcase falleth on any sown seed which is sown--it [is] clean;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and when water is put on the seed, and [any] of its carcase hath fallen on it-- unclean it [is] to you.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> `And when any of the beasts which are to you for food dieth, he who is coming against its carcase is unclean till the evening;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> and he who is eating of its carcase doth wash his garments, and hath been unclean till the evening; and he who is lifting up its carcase doth wash his garments, and hath been unclean till the evening.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> `And every teeming thing which is teeming on the earth is an abomination, it is not eaten;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> any thing going on the belly, and any going on four, unto every multiplier of feet, to every teeming thing which is teeming on the earth--ye do not eat them, for they [are] an abomination;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> ye do not make yourselves abominable with any teeming thing which is teeming, nor do ye make yourselves unclean with them, so that ye have been unclean thereby.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> `For I [am] Jehovah your God, and ye have sanctified yourselves, and ye have been holy, for I [am] holy; and ye do not defile your persons with any teeming thing which is creeping on the earth;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> for I [am] Jehovah who am bringing you up out of the land of Egypt to become your God; and ye have been holy, for I [am] holy.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> `This [is] a law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature which is moving in the waters, and of every creature which is teeming on the earth,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> to make separation between the unclean and the pure, and between the beast that is eaten, and the beast that is not eaten.'</p>
