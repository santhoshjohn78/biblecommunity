<h2>Jeremiah 33</h2>

<p><a id="c33_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah a second time--and he [is] yet detained in the court of the prison--saying:</p>

<p><a id="c33_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thus said Jehovah its maker, Jehovah its former, at establishing it, Jehovah [is] His name:</p>

<p><a id="c33_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Call unto Me, and I do answer thee, yea, I declare to thee great and fenced things-- thou hast not known them.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, that are broken down for the mounts, and for the tool;</p>

<p><a id="c33_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> they are coming in to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the carcases of men, whom I have smitten in Mine anger, and in My fury, and [for] whom I have hidden My face from this city, because of all their evil:</p>

<p><a id="c33_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Lo, I am increasing to it health and cure, And have healed them, and revealed to them The abundance of peace and truth.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I have turned back the captivity of Judah, And the captivity of Israel, And I have built them as at the first,</p>

<p><a id="c33_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And cleansed them from all their iniquity, That they have sinned against Me, And I have pardoned all their iniquities, That they have sinned against Me, And that they transgressed against Me.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And it hath been to Me for a name of joy, For praise, and for beauty, to all nations of the earth, Who hear of all the good that I am doing them, And they have feared, And they have trembled for all the good, And for all the peace, that I am doing to it.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Thus said Jehovah: Again heard in this place of which ye are saying, Waste it [is], without man and without beast, In cities of Judah, and in streets of Jerusalem, That are desolated, without man, And without inhabitant, and without beast,</p>

<p><a id="c33_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Is a voice of joy and a voice of gladness, Voice of bridegroom, and voice of bride, The voice of those saying, Thank Jehovah of Hosts, for Jehovah [is] good, For His kindness [is] to the age, Who are bringing in thanksgiving to the house of Jehovah, For I turn back the captivity of the land, As at the first, said Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Again there is in this place--that is waste, Without man and beast, And in all its cities--a habitation of shepherds, Causing the flock to lie down.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> In the cities of the hill-country, In the cities of the low country, And in the cities of the south, And in the land of Benjamin, And in the suburbs of Jerusalem, And in the cities of Judah, Again doth the flock pass by under the hands of the numberer, said Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Lo, days are coming, an affirmation of Jehovah, And I have established the good word That I spake unto the house of Israel, And concerning the house of Judah.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> In those days, and at that time, I cause to shoot up to David a shoot of righteousness, And he hath done judgment and righteousness in the earth.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> In those days is Judah saved, And Jerusalem doth dwell confidently, And this [is] he whom Jehovah proclaimeth to her: `Our Righteousness.'</p>

<p><a id="c33_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For thus said Jehovah: `Not cut off to David is one sitting on the throne of the house of Israel,</p>

<p><a id="c33_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And to the priests--the Levites, Not cut off from before Me is one, Causing a burnt-offering to ascend, And perfuming a present, and making sacrifice--all the days.'</p>

<p><a id="c33_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c33_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> `Thus said Jehovah: If ye do break My covenant of the day, And My covenant of the night, So that they are not daily and nightly in their season,</p>

<p><a id="c33_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Also My covenant is broken with David My servant, So that he hath not a son reigning on his throne, And with the Levites the priests, My ministers.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> As the host of the heavens is not numbered, Nor the sand of the sea measured, So I multiply the seed of David My servant, And the Levites My ministers.'</p>

<p><a id="c33_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c33_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> `Hast thou not considered what this people have spoken, saying: The two families on which Jehovah fixed, He doth reject them, And my people they despise--So that they are no more a people before them!</p>

<p><a id="c33_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Thus said Jehovah: If My covenant [is] not daily and nightly, The statutes of heaven and earth I have not appointed--</p>

<p><a id="c33_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Also the seed of Jacob, and David My servant, I reject, Against taking from his seed rulers For the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, For I turn back [to] their captivity, and have pitied them.'</p>
