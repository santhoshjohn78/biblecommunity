<h2>Hebrews 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> for we do enter into the rest--we who did believe, as He said, `So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest--;' and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh [day] thus: `And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and in this [place] again, `If they shall enter into My rest--;'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> since then, it remaineth for certain to enter into it, and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief--</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> again He doth limit a certain day, `To-day,' (in David saying, after so long a time,) as it hath been said, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts,'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of God,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his works, as God from His own.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him, but all things [are] naked and open to His eyes--with whom is our reckoning.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the heavens--Jesus the Son of God- -may we hold fast the profession,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with our infirmities, but [one] tempted in all things in like manner--apart from sin;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace--for seasonable help.</p>
