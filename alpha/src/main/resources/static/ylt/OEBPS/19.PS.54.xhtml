<h2>Psalms 54</h2>

<p><a id="c54_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To the Overseer with stringed instruments. --An instruction, by David, in the coming in of the Ziphim, and they say to Saul, `Is not David hiding himself with us?' O God, by Thy name save me, and by Thy might judge me.</p>

<p><a id="c54_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> O God, hear my prayer, Give ear to the sayings of my mouth,</p>

<p><a id="c54_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For strangers have risen up against me And terrible ones have sought my soul, They have not set God before them. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c54_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Lo, God [is] a helper to me, The Lord [is] with those supporting my soul,</p>

<p><a id="c54_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Turn back doth the evil thing to mine enemies, In Thy truth cut them off.</p>

<p><a id="c54_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> With a free will-offering I sacrifice to Thee, I thank Thy name, O Jehovah, for [it is] good,</p>

<p><a id="c54_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For, from all adversity He delivered me, And on mine enemies hath mine eye looked!</p>
