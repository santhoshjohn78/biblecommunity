<h2>Psalms 20</h2>

<p><a id="c20_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To the Overseer. --A Psalm of David. Jehovah doth answer thee, In a day of adversity, The name of the God of Jacob doth set thee on high,</p>

<p><a id="c20_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> He doth send thy help from the sanctuary, And from Zion doth support thee,</p>

<p><a id="c20_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He doth remember all thy presents, And thy burnt-offering doth reduce to ashes. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He doth give to thee according to thy heart, And all thy counsel doth fulfil.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> We sing of thy salvation, And in the name of our God set up a banner. Jehovah doth fulfil all thy requests.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Now I have known That Jehovah hath saved His anointed, He answereth him from His holy heavens, With the saving might of His right hand.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Some of chariots, and some of horses, And we of the name of Jehovah our God Make mention.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> They--they have bowed and have fallen, And we have risen and station ourselves upright.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> O Jehovah, save the king, He doth answer us in the day we call!</p>
