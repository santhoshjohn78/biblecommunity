<h2>1 Timothy 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Stedfast [is] the word: If any one the oversight doth long for, a right work he desireth;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> it behoveth, therefore, the overseer to be blameless, of one wife a husband, vigilant, sober, decent, a friend of strangers, apt to teach,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre, but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> his own house leading well, having children in subjection with all gravity,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> (and if any one his own house [how] to lead hath not known, how an assembly of God shall he take care of?)</p>

<p><a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall to a judgment of the devil;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and it behoveth him also to have a good testimony from those without, that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the devil.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Ministrants--in like manner grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not given to filthy lucre,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> having the secret of the faith in a pure conscience,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and let these also first be proved, then let them minister, being unblameable.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Women--in like manner grave, not false accusers, vigilant, faithful in all things.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Ministrants--let them be of one wife husbands; the children leading well, and their own houses,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> for those who did minister well a good step to themselves do acquire, and much boldness in faith that [is] in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> These things I write to thee, hoping to come unto thee soon,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and if I delay, that thou mayest know how it behoveth [thee] to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is an assembly of the living God--a pillar and foundation of the truth,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and, confessedly, great is the secret of piety--God was manifested in flesh, declared righteous in spirit, seen by messengers, preached among nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory!</p>
