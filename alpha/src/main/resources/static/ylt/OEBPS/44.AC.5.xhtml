<h2>Acts 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and did keep back of the price--his wife also knowing--and having brought a certain part, at the feet of the apostles he laid [it].</p>

<p><a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Peter said, `Ananias, wherefore did the Adversary fill thy heart, for thee to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back of the price of the place?</p>

<p><a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> while it remained, did it not remain thine? and having been sold, in thy authority was it not? why [is] it that thou didst put in thy heart this thing? thou didst not lie to men, but to God;'</p>

<p><a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and Ananias hearing these words, having fallen down, did expire, and great fear came upon all who heard these things,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and having risen, the younger men wound him up, and having carried forth, they buried [him].</p>

<p><a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And it came to pass, about three hours after, that his wife, not knowing what hath happened, came in,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and Peter answered her, `Tell me if for so much ye sold the place;' and she said, `Yes, for so much.'</p>

<p><a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Peter said unto her, `How was it agreed by you, to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? lo, the feet of those who did bury thy husband [are] at the door, and they shall carry thee forth;'</p>

<p><a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and she fell down presently at his feet, and expired, and the young men having come in, found her dead, and having carried forth, they buried [her] by her husband;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and great fear came upon all the assembly, and upon all who heard these things.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And through the hands of the apostles came many signs and wonders among the people, and they were with one accord all in the porch of Solomon;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and of the rest no one was daring to join himself to them, but the people were magnifying them,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> (and the more were believers added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women,)</p>

<p><a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> so as into the broad places to bring forth the ailing, and to lay [them] upon couches and mats, that at the coming of Peter, even [his] shadow might overshadow some one of them;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and there were coming together also the people of the cities round about to Jerusalem, bearing ailing persons, and those harassed by unclean spirits--who were all healed.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And having risen, the chief priest, and all those with him--being the sect of the Sadducees--were filled with zeal,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and laid their hands upon the apostles, and did put them in a public prison;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and a messenger of the Lord through the night opened the doors of the prison, having also brought them forth, he said,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> `Go on, and standing, speak in the temple to the people all the sayings of this life;'</p>

<p><a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and having heard, they did enter at the dawn into the temple, and were teaching. And the chief priest having come, and those with him, they called together the sanhedrim and all the senate of the sons of Israel, and they sent to the prison to have them brought,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and the officers having come, did not find them in the prison, and having turned back, they told,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> saying--`The prison indeed we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors, and having opened--within we found no one.'</p>

<p><a id="c5_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And as the priest, and the magistrate of the temple, and the chief priests, heard these words, they were doubting concerning them to what this would come;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and coming near, a certain one told them, saying--`Lo, the men whom ye did put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people;'</p>

<p><a id="c5_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> then the magistrate having gone away with officers, brought them without violence, for they were fearing the people, lest they should be stoned;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and having brought them, they set [them] in the sanhedrim, and the chief priest questioned them,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> saying, `Did not we strictly command you not to teach in this name? and lo, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and ye intend to bring upon us the blood of this man.'</p>

<p><a id="c5_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Peter and the apostles answering, said, `To obey God it behoveth, rather than men;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and the God of our fathers did raise up Jesus, whom ye slew, having hanged upon a tree;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> this one God, a Prince and a Saviour, hath exalted with His right hand, to give reformation to Israel, and forgiveness of sins;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and we are His witnesses of these sayings, and the Holy Spirit also, whom God gave to those obeying him.'</p>

<p><a id="c5_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And they having heard, were cut [to the heart], and were taking counsel to slay them,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> but a certain one, having risen up in the sanhedrim--a Pharisee, by name Gamaliel, a teacher of law honoured by all the people--commanded to put the apostles forth a little,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> and said unto them, `Men, Israelites, take heed to yourselves about these men, what ye are about to do,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> for before these days rose up Theudas, saying, that himself was some one, to whom a number of men did join themselves, as it were four hundred, who was slain, and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered, and came to nought.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> `After this one rose up, Judas the Galilean, in the days of the enrolment, and drew away much people after him, and that one perished, and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone, because if this counsel or this work may be of men, it will be overthrown,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> and if it be of God, ye are not able to overthrow it, lest perhaps also ye be found fighting against God.'</p>

<p><a id="c5_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And to him they agreed, and having called near the apostles, having beaten [them], they commanded [them] not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> they, indeed, then, departed from the presence of the sanhedrim, rejoicing that for his name they were counted worthy to suffer dishonour,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> every day also in the temple, and in every house, they were not ceasing teaching and proclaiming good news--Jesus the Christ.</p>
