<h2>Judges 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it cometh to pass, after [some] days, in the days of wheat-harvest, that Samson looketh after his wife, with a kid of the goats, and saith, `I go in unto my wife, to the inner chamber;' and her father hath not permitted him to go in,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and her father saith, I certainly said, that thou didst certainly hate her, and I give her to thy companion; is not her sister--the young one--better than she? Let her be, I pray thee, to thee, instead of her.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Samson saith of them, `I am more innocent this time than the Philistines, though I am doing with them evil.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Samson goeth and catcheth three hundred foxes, and taketh torches, and turneth tail unto tail, and putteth a torch between the two tails, in the midst,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and kindleth fire in the torches, and sendeth [them] out into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burneth [it] from heap even unto standing corn, even unto vineyard--olive-yard.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the Philistines say, `Who hath done this?' And they say, `Samson, son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken away his wife, and giveth her to his companion;' and the Philistines go up, and burn her and her father with fire.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Samson saith to them, `Though ye do thus, nevertheless I am avenged on you, and afterwards I cease!'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he smiteth them hip and thigh--a great smiting, and goeth down and dwelleth in the cleft of the rock Etam.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the Philistines go up, and encamp in Judah, and are spread out in Lehi,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and the men of Judah say, `Why have ye come up against us?' and they say, `To bind Samson we have come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And three thousand men of Judah go down unto the cleft of the rock Etam, and say to Samson, `Hast thou now known that the Philistines are rulers over us? and what [is] this thou hast done to us?' And he saith to them, `As they did to me, so I did to them.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And they say to him, `To bind thee we have come down--to give thee into the hand of the Philistines.' And Samson saith to them, `Swear to me, lest ye fall upon me yourselves.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And they speak to him, saying, No, but we certainly bind thee, and have given thee into their hand, and we certainly do not put thee to death;' and they bind him with two thick bands, new ones, and bring him up from the rock.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> He hath come unto Lehi--and the Philistines have shouted at meeting him--and the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him, and the thick bands which [are] on his arms are as flax which they burn with fire, and his bands are wasted from off his hands,</p>

<p><a id="c15_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and he findeth a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, and putteth forth his hand and taketh it, and smiteth with it--a thousand men.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Samson saith, `With a jaw-bone of the ass--an ass upon asses--with a jaw-bone of the ass I have smitten a thousand men.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And it cometh to pass when he finisheth speaking, that he casteth away the jaw-bone out of his hand, and calleth that place Ramath-Lehi;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and he thirsteth exceedingly, and calleth unto Jehovah, and saith, `Thou--Thou hast given by the hand of Thy servant this great salvation; and now, I die with thirst, and have fallen into the hand of the uncircumcised.'</p>

<p><a id="c15_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And God cleaveth the hollow place which [is] in Lehi, and waters come out of it, and he drinketh, and his spirit cometh back, and he reviveth; therefore hath [one] called its name `The fountain of him who is calling,' which [is] in Lehi untothis day.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And he judgeth Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</p>
