<h2>Exodus 30</h2>

<p><a id="c30_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> `And thou hast made an altar [for] making perfume; [of] shittim wood thou dost make it;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> a cubit its length, and a cubit its breadth, (it is square), and two cubits its height; its horns [are] of the same.</p>

<p><a id="c30_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> `And thou hast overlaid it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and thou hast made to it a crown of gold round about;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and two rings of gold thou dost make to it under its crown; on its two ribs thou dost make [them], on its two sides, and they have become places for staves, to bear it with them.</p>

<p><a id="c30_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> `And thou hast made the staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them with gold;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and thou hast put it before the vail, which [is] by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat which [is] over the testimony, whither I am met with thee.</p>

<p><a id="c30_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `And Aaron hath made perfume on it, perfume of spices, morning by morning; in his making the lamps right he doth perfume it,</p>

<p><a id="c30_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and in Aaron's causing the lamps to go up between the evenings, he doth perfume it; a continual perfume before Jehovah to your generations.</p>

<p><a id="c30_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> `Ye do not cause strange perfume to go up upon it, and burnt-offering, and present, and libation ye do not pour out on it;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and Aaron hath made atonement on its horns, once in a year, by the blood of the sinoffering of atonements; once in a year doth he make atonement for it, to your generations; it [is] most holy to Jehovah.'</p>

<p><a id="c30_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c30_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> `When thou takest up the sum of the sons of Israel for their numbers, then they have given each an atonement [for] his soul to Jehovah in their being numbered, and there is no plague among them in their being numbered.</p>

<p><a id="c30_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> `This they do give, every one passing over unto those numbered, half a shekel, by the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel [is] twenty gerahs); half a shekel [is] the heave-offering to Jehovah;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> every one passing over unto those numbered, from a son of twenty years and upwards, doth give the heave-offering of Jehovah;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> the rich doth not multiply, and the poor doth not diminish from the half-shekel, to give the heave-offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.</p>

<p><a id="c30_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> `And thou hast taken the atonement-money from the sons of Israel, and hast given it for the service of the tent of meeting; and it hath been to the sons of Israel for a memorial before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.'</p>

<p><a id="c30_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c30_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> `And thou hast made a laver of brass (and its base of brass), for washing; and thou hast put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and hast put water there;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and Aaron and his sons have washed at it their hands and their feet,</p>

<p><a id="c30_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> in their going in unto the tent of meeting they wash [with] water, and die not; or in their drawing nigh unto the altar to minister, to perfume a fire-offering to Jehovah,</p>

<p><a id="c30_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> then they have washed their hands and their feet, and they die not, and it hath been to them a statute age-during, to him and to his seed to their generations.'</p>

<p><a id="c30_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c30_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> `And thou, take to thyself principal spices, wild honey five hundred [shekels]; and spice-cinnamon, the half of that, two hundred and fifty; and spice-cane two hundred and fifty;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and cassia five hundred, by the shekel of the sanctuary, and olive oil a hin;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and thou hast made it a holy anointing oil, a compound mixture, work of a compounder; it is a holy anointing oil.</p>

<p><a id="c30_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> `And thou hast anointed with it the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony,</p>

<p><a id="c30_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and the table and all its vessels, and the candlestick and its vessels, and the altar of perfume,</p>

<p><a id="c30_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and the altar of burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the laver and its base;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and thou hast sanctified them, and they have been most holy; all that is coming against them is holy;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and Aaron and his sons thou dost anoint, and hast sanctified them for being priests to Me.</p>

<p><a id="c30_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> `And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak, saying, A holy anointing oil is this to Me, to your generations;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> on flesh of man it is not poured, and with its proper proportion ye make none like it; it [is] holy; it is holy to you;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> a man who compoundeth [any] like it, or who putteth of it on a stranger--hath even been cut off from his people.'</p>

<p><a id="c30_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Take to thee spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, spices and pure frankincense; they are part for part;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> and thou hast made it a perfume, a compound, work of a compounder, salted, pure, holy;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> and thou hast beaten [some] of it small, and hast put of it before the testimony, in the tent of meeting, whither I am met with thee; most holy it is to you.</p>

<p><a id="c30_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> `As to the perfume which thou makest, with its proper proportion ye do not make to yourselves, holy it is to thee to Jehovah;</p>

<p><a id="c30_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> a man who maketh [any] like it--to be refreshed by it--hath even been cut off from his people.'</p>
