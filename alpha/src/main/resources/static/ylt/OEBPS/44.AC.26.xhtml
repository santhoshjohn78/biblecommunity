<h2>Acts 26</h2>

<p><a id="c26_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Agrippa said unto Paul, `It is permitted to thee to speak for thyself;' then Paul having stretched forth the hand, was making a defence:</p>

<p><a id="c26_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Concerning all things of which I am accused by Jews, king Agrippa, I have thought myself happy, being about to make a defence before thee to-day,</p>

<p><a id="c26_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> especially knowing thee to be acquainted with all things--both customs and questions-- among Jews; wherefore, I beseech thee, patiently to hear me.</p>

<p><a id="c26_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> `The manner of my life then, indeed, from youth--which from the beginning was among my nation, in Jerusalem--know do all the Jews,</p>

<p><a id="c26_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> knowing me before from the first, (if they may be willing to testify,) that after the most exact sect of our worship, I lived a Pharisee;</p>

<p><a id="c26_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and now for the hope of the promise made to the fathers by God, I have stood judged,</p>

<p><a id="c26_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> to which our twelve tribes, intently night and day serving, do hope to come, concerning which hope I am accused, king Agrippa, by the Jews;</p>

<p><a id="c26_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?</p>

<p><a id="c26_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> `I, indeed, therefore, thought with myself, that against the name of Jesus of Nazareth it behoved [me] many things to do,</p>

<p><a id="c26_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> which also I did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I in prison did shut up, from the chief priests having received the authority; they also being put to death, I gave my vote against them,</p>

<p><a id="c26_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and in every synagogue, often punishing them, I was constraining [them] to speak evil, being also exceedingly mad against them, I was also persecuting [them] even unto strange cities.</p>

<p><a id="c26_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> `In which things, also, going on to Damascus--with authority and commission from the chief priests--</p>

<p><a id="c26_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> at mid-day, I saw in the way, O king, out of heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me a light--and those going on with me;</p>

<p><a id="c26_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and we all having fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why me dost thou persecute? hard for thee against pricks to kick!</p>

<p><a id="c26_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> `And I said, Who art thou, Lord? and he said, I am Jesus whom thou dost persecute;</p>

<p><a id="c26_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> but rise, and stand upon thy feet, for for this I appeared to thee, to appoint thee an officer and a witness both of the things thou didst see, and of the things [in which] I will appear to thee,</p>

<p><a id="c26_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> delivering thee from the people, and the nations, to whom now I send thee,</p>

<p><a id="c26_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> to open their eyes, to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the authority of the Adversary unto God, for their receiving forgiveness of sins, and a lot among those having been sanctified, by faith that [is] toward me.</p>

<p><a id="c26_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> `Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</p>

<p><a id="c26_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> but to those in Damascus first, and to those in Jerusalem, to all the region also of Judea, and to the nations, I was preaching to reform, and to turn back unto God, doing works worthy of reformation;</p>

<p><a id="c26_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> because of these things the Jews--having caught me in the temple--were endeavouring to kill [me].</p>

<p><a id="c26_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> `Having obtained, therefore, help from God, till this day, I have stood witnessing both to small and to great, saying nothing besides the things that both the prophets and Moses spake of as about to come,</p>

<p><a id="c26_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> that the Christ is to suffer, whether first by a rising from the dead, he is about to proclaim light to the people and to the nations.'</p>

<p><a id="c26_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And, he thus making a defence, Festus with a loud voice said, `Thou art mad, Paul; much learning doth turn thee mad;'</p>

<p><a id="c26_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and he saith, `I am not mad, most noble Festus, but of truth and soberness the sayings I speak forth;</p>

<p><a id="c26_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> for the king doth know concerning these things, before whom also I speak boldly, for none of these things, I am persuaded, are hidden from him; for this thing hath not been done in a corner;</p>

<p><a id="c26_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> thou dost believe, king Agrippa, the prophets? I have known that thou dost believe!'</p>

<p><a id="c26_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And Agrippa said unto Paul, `In a little thou dost persuade me to become a Christian!'</p>

<p><a id="c26_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and Paul said, `I would have wished to God, both in a little, and in much, not only thee, but also all those hearing me to-day, to become such as I also am--except these bonds.'</p>

<p><a id="c26_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And, he having spoken these things, the king rose up, and the governor, Bernice also, and those sitting with them,</p>

<p><a id="c26_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and having withdrawn, they were speaking unto one another, saying--`This man doth nothing worthy of death or of bonds;'</p>

<p><a id="c26_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and Agrippa said to Festus, `This man might have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.'</p>
