<h2>1 Kings 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then doth Solomon assemble the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, princes of the fathers of the sons of Israel, unto king Solomon, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the city of David--it [is] Zion;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and all the men of Israel are assembled unto king Solomon, in the month of Ethanim, in the festival--[is] the seventh month.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And all the elders of Israel come in, and the priests lift up the ark,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and bring up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that [are] in the tent, yea, the priests and the Levites bring them up.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And king Solomon and all the company of Israel who are met unto him [are] with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that are not counted nor numbered for multitude.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the priests bring in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, unto the oracle of the house, unto the holy of holies, unto the place of the wings of the cherubs;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> for the cherubs are spreading forth two wings unto the place of the ark, and the cherubs cover over the ark, and over its staves from above;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and they lengthen the staves, and the heads of the staves are seen from the holy [place] on the front of the oracle, and are not seen without, and they are there unto this day.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> There is nothing in the ark, only the two tables of stone which Moses put there in Horeb, when Jehovah covenanted with the sons of Israel in their going out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And it cometh to pass, in the going out of the priests from the holy [place], that the cloud hath filled the house of Jehovah,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and the priests have not been able to stand to minister because of the cloud, for the honour of Jehovah hath filled the house of Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Then said Solomon, `Jehovah hath said to dwell in thick darkness;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I have surely built a house of habitation for Thee; a fixed place for Thine abiding to the ages.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the king turneth round his face, and blesseth the whole assembly of Israel; and all the assembly of Israel is standing.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he saith, `Blessed [is] Jehovah, God of Israel, who spake by His mouth with David my father, and by His hand hath fulfilled [it], saying,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> From the day that I brought out My people, even Israel, from Egypt, I have not fixed on a city out of all the tribes of Israel, to build a house for My name being there; and I fix on David to be over My people Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> `And it is with the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, God of Israel,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and Jehovah saith unto David my father, Because that it hath been with thy heart to build a house for My name, thou hast done well that it hath been with thy heart;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> only, thou dost not build the house, but thy son who is coming out from thy loins, he doth build the house for My name.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> `And Jehovah doth establish His word which He spake, and I am risen up instead of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah spake, and build the house for the name of Jehovah, God of Israel,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and set there a place for the ark, where [is] the covenant of Jehovah which He made with our fathers in His bringing them out from the land of Egypt.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Solomon standeth before the altar of Jehovah, over-against all the assembly of Israel, and spreadeth his hands towards the heavens,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and saith, `Jehovah, God of Israel, there is not a God like Thee, in the heavens above, and on the earth beneath, keeping the covenant and the kindness for Thy servants, those walking before Thee with all their heart,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> who hast kept for Thy servant David my father that which Thou spakest to him; yea, Thou speakest with Thy mouth, and with Thy hand hast fulfilled [it], as [at] this day.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> `And now, Jehovah, God of Israel, keep for Thy servant David my father that which Thou spakest to him, saying, There is not cut off to thee a man from before Me, sitting on the throne of Israel--only, if thy sons watch their way, to walk before Me as thou hast walked before Me.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> `And now, O God of Israel, let it be established, I pray Thee, Thy word which Thou hast spoken to Thy servant, David my father.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> But, is it true? --God dwelleth on the earth! lo, the heavens, and the heavens of the heavens do not contain Thee, how much less this house which I have builded!</p>

<p><a id="c8_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> `Then thou hast turned unto the prayer of Thy servant, and unto his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and unto the prayer which Thy servant is praying before Thee to-day,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> for Thine eyes being open towards this house night and day, towards the place of which Thou hast said, My Name is there; to hearken unto the prayer which Thy servant prayeth towards this place.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> `Then Thou hast hearkened unto the supplication of Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel, which they pray towards this place; yea, Thou dost hearken in the place of Thy dwelling, in the heavens--and Thou hast hearkened, and hast forgiven,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> that which a man sinneth against his neighbour, and he hath lifted up upon him an oath to cause him to swear, and the oath hath come in before Thine altar in this house,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> then Thou dost hear in the heavens, and hast done, and hast judged Thy servants, to declare wicked the wicked, to put his way on his head, and to declare righteous the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> `In Thy people Israel being smitten before an enemy, because they sin against Thee, and they have turned back unto Thee, and have confessed Thy name, and prayed, and made supplication unto Thee in this house,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> then thou dost hear in the heavens, and hast forgiven the sin of Thy people Israel, and brought them back unto the ground that Thou gavest to their fathers.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> `In the heavens being restrained, and there is no rain, because they sin against Thee, and they have prayed towards this place, and confessed Thy name, and from their sin turn back, for Thou dost afflict them,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> then Thou dost hear in the heavens, and hast forgiven the sin of Thy servants, and of Thy people Israel, for Thou directest them the good way in which they go, and hast given rain on Thy land which Thou hast given to Thy people for inheritance.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> `Famine--when it is in the land; pestilence--when it is; blasting, mildew, locust; caterpillar--when it is; when its enemy hath distressed it in the land [in] its gates, any plague, any sickness, --</p>

<p><a id="c8_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> any prayer, any supplication that [is] of any man of all Thy people Israel, who know each the plague of his own heart, and hath spread his hands towards this house,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> then Thou dost hear in the heavens, the settled place of Thy dwelling, and hast forgiven, and hast done, and hast given to each according to all his ways, whose heart Thou knowest, (for Thou hast known--Thyself alone--the heart of all the sons of man),</p>

<p><a id="c8_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> so that they fear Thee all the days that they are living on the face of the ground that Thou hast given to our fathers.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> `And also, unto the stranger who is not of Thy people Israel, and hath come from a land afar off for Thy name's sake--</p>

<p><a id="c8_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> (for they hear of Thy great name, and of Thy strong hand, and of Thy stretched-out arm) --and he hath come in and prayed towards this house,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> Thou dost hear in the heavens, the settled place of Thy dwelling, and hast done according to all that the stranger calleth unto Thee for, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know Thy name, to fear Thee like Thy people Israel, and to know that Thy name hath been called on this house which I have builded.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> `When Thy people doth go out to battle against its enemy, in the way that Thou dost send them, and they have prayed unto Jehovah the way of the city which thou hast fixed on, and of the house which I have builded for Thy name;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> then Thou hast heard in the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and hast maintained their cause.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> `When they sin against Thee (for there is not a man who sinneth not), and Thou hast been angry with them, and hast given them up before an enemy, and they have taken captive their captivity unto the land of the enemy far off or near;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> and they have turned [it] back unto their heart in the land whither they have been taken captive, and have turned back, and made supplication unto Thee, in the land of their captors, saying, We have sinned and done perversely--we have done wickedly;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v48"></a><span class="vn">48</span> yea, they have turned back unto Thee, with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies who have taken them captive, and have prayed unto Thee the way of their land, which Thou gavest to their fathers, the city which Thou hast chosen, and the house which I have builded for Thy name:</p>

<p><a id="c8_v49"></a><span class="vn">49</span> `Then Thou hast heard in the heavens, the settled place of Thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplication, and hast maintained their cause,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v50"></a><span class="vn">50</span> and hast forgiven Thy people who have sinned against Thee, even all their transgressions which they have transgressed against Thee, and hast given them mercies before their captors, and they have had mercy [on] them--</p>

<p><a id="c8_v51"></a><span class="vn">51</span> (for Thy people and Thy inheritance [are] they, whom Thou didst bring out of Egypt, out of the midst of the furnace of iron) --</p>

<p><a id="c8_v52"></a><span class="vn">52</span> for Thine eyes being open unto the supplication of Thy servant, and unto the supplication of Thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all they call unto Thee for;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v53"></a><span class="vn">53</span> for Thou hast separated them to Thyself for an inheritance, out of all the peoples of the earth, as Thou didst speak by the hand of Moses Thy servant, in Thy bringing out our fathers from Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v54"></a><span class="vn">54</span> And it cometh to pass, at Solomon's finishing to pray unto Jehovah all this prayer and supplication, he hath risen from before the altar of Jehovah, from bending on his knees, and his hands spread out to the heavens,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v55"></a><span class="vn">55</span> and he standeth and blesseth all the assembly of Israel [with] a loud voice, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v56"></a><span class="vn">56</span> `Blessed [is] Jehovah who hath given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He hath spoken; there hath not fallen one word of all His good word, which He spake by the hand of Moses his servant.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v57"></a><span class="vn">57</span> `Jehovah our God is with us as He hath been with our fathers; He doth not forsake us nor leave us;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v58"></a><span class="vn">58</span> to incline our heart unto Himself, to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commands, and His statutes, and His judgments, which He commanded our fathers;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v59"></a><span class="vn">59</span> and these my words with which I have made supplication before Jehovah, are near unto Jehovah our God by day and by night, to maintain the cause of His servant, and the cause of His people Israel, the matter of a day in its day;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v60"></a><span class="vn">60</span> for all the peoples of the earth knowing that Jehovah, He [is] God; there is none else;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v61"></a><span class="vn">61</span> and your heart hath been perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in His statutes, and to keep His commands, as [at] this day.'</p>

<p><a id="c8_v62"></a><span class="vn">62</span> And the king and all Israel with him are sacrificing a sacrifice before Jehovah;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v63"></a><span class="vn">63</span> and Solomon sacrificeth the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he hath sacrificed to Jehovah, oxen, twenty and two thousand, and sheep, a hundred and twenty thousand; and the king and all the sons of Israel dedicate the house of Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v64"></a><span class="vn">64</span> On that day hath the king sanctified the middle of the court that [is] before the house of Jehovah, for he hath made there the burnt-offering, and the present, and the fat of the peaceofferings; for the altar of brass that [is] before Jehovah [is] too little to contain the burnt-offering, and the present, and the fat of the peace-offerings.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v65"></a><span class="vn">65</span> And Solomon maketh, at that time, the festival--and all Israel with him, a great assembly from the entering in of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt--before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days; fourteen days.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v66"></a><span class="vn">66</span> On the eighth day he hath sent the people away, and they bless the king, and go to their tents, rejoicing and glad of heart for all the good that Jehovah hath done to David His servant, and to Israel His people.</p>
