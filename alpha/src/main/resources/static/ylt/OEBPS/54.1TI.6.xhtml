<h2>1 Timothy 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> As many as are servants under a yoke, their own masters worthy of all honour let them reckon, that the name of God and the teaching may not be evil spoken of;</p>

<p><a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and those having believing masters, let them not slight [them], because they are brethren, but rather let them serve, because they are stedfast and beloved, who of the benefit are partaking. These things be teaching and exhorting;</p>

<p><a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> if any one be teaching otherwise, and do not consent to sound words--those of our Lord Jesus Christ--and to the teaching according to piety,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and word-striving, out of which doth come envy, strife, evil-speakings, evil-surmisings,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> wranglings of men wholly corrupted in mind, and destitute of the truth, supposing the piety to be gain; depart from such;</p>

<p><a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> but it is great gain--the piety with contentment;</p>

<p><a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> for nothing did we bring into the world--[it is] manifest that we are able to carry nothing out;</p>

<p><a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> but having food and raiment--with these we shall suffice ourselves;</p>

<p><a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and those wishing to be rich, do fall into temptation and a snare, and many desires, foolish and hurtful, that sink men into ruin and destruction,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for a root of all the evils is the love of money, which certain longing for did go astray from the faith, and themselves did pierce through with many sorrows;</p>

<p><a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and thou, O man of God, these things flee, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, meekness;</p>

<p><a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> be striving the good strife of the faith, be laying hold on the life age-during, to which also thou wast called, and didst profess the right profession before many witnesses.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I charge thee, before God, who is making all things alive, and of Christ Jesus, who did testify before Pontius Pilate the right profession,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> that thou keep the command unspotted, unblameable, till the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> which in His own times He shall shew--the blessed and only potentate, the King of the kings and Lord of the lords,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> who only is having immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no one of men did see, nor is able to see, to whom [is] honour and might age-during! Amen.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Those rich in the present age charge thou not to be high-minded, nor to hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, who is giving to us all things richly for enjoyment; --</p>

<p><a id="c6_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> to do good, to be rich in good works, to be ready to impart, willing to communicate,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> treasuring up to themselves a right foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life age-during.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> O Timotheus, the thing entrusted guard thou, avoiding the profane vain-words and opposition of the falsely-named knowledge,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> which certain professing--concerning the faith did swerve; the grace [is] with you. Amen.</p>
