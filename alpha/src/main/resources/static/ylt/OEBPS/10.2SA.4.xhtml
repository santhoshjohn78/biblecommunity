<h2>2 Samuel 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the son of Saul heareth that Abner [is] dead in Hebron, and his hands are feeble, and all Israel have been troubled.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And two men, heads of troops, have been [to] the son of Saul, the name of the one [is] Baanah, and the name of the second Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin, for also Beeroth is reckoned to Benjamin,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and the Beerothites flee to Gittaim, and are there sojourners unto this day.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And to Jonathan son of Saul [is] a son--lame; he was a son of five years at the coming in of the rumour of [the death of] Saul and Jonathan, out of Jezreel, and his nurse lifteth him up, and fleeth, and it cometh to pass in her hasting to flee, that he falleth, and becometh lame, and his name [is] Mephibosheth.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, go, and come in at the heat of the day unto the house of Ish-Bosheth, and he is lying down--the lying down of noon;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and thither they have come, unto the midst of the house, taking wheat, and they smite him unto the fifth [rib], and Rechab and Baanah his brother have escaped;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> yea, they come in to the house, and he is lying on his bed, in the inner part of his bedchamber, and they smite him, and put him to death, and turn aside his head, and they take his head, and go the way of the plain all the night,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and bring in the head of Ish-Bosheth unto David in Hebron, and say unto the king, `Lo, the head of Ish-Bosheth, son of Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life; and Jehovah doth give to my lord the king vengeance this day, of Saul and of his seed.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And David answereth Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and saith to them, `Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> when one is declaring to me, saying, Lo, Saul is dead, and he was as a bearer of tidings in his own eyes, then I take hold on him, and slay him in Ziklag, instead of my giving to him [for] the tidings.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Also--when wicked men have slain the righteous man in his own house, on his bed; and now, do not I require his blood of your hand, and have taken you away from the earth?'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And David commandeth the young men, and they slay them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hang [them] over the pool in Hebron, and the head of Ish-Bosheth they have taken, and bury [it] in the burying-place of Abner in Hebron.</p>
