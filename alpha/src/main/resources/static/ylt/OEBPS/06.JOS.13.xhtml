<h2>Joshua 13</h2>

<p><a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Joshua is old, entering into days, and Jehovah saith unto him, `Thou hast become aged, thou hast entered into days; as to the land, very much hath been left to possess.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `This [is] the land that is left; all the circuits of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> from Sihor which [is] on the front of Egypt, and unto the border of Ekron northward, to the Canaanite it is reckoned, five princes of the Philistines, the Gazathite, and the Ashdothite, the Eshkalonite, the Gittite, and the Ekronite, also theAvim.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> `From the south, all the land of the Canaanite, and Mearah, which [is] to the Sidonians, unto Aphek, unto the border of the Amorite;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and the land of the Giblite, and all Lebanon, at the sun-rising, from Baal-Gad under mount Hermon, unto the going in to Hamath:</p>

<p><a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> all the inhabitants of the hill-country, from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-Maim, all the Sidonians: I--I dispossess them before the sons of Israel; only, cause it to fall to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `And now, apportion this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh,' --</p>

<p><a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> with it the Reubenite, and the Gadite, have received their inheritance, which Moses hath given to them beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses servant of Jehovah hath given to them;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> from Aroer, which [is] on the edge of the brook Arnon, and the city which [is] in the midst of the brook, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dihon,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorite, who reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the Bene-Ammon,</p>

<p><a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei; he was left of the remnant of the Rephaim, and Moses doth smite them, and dispossess them;</p>

<p><a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and the sons of Israel dispossessed not the Geshurite, and the Maachathite; and Geshur and Maachath dwell in the midst of Israel unto this day.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Only, to the tribe of Levi he hath not given an inheritance; fire-offerings of Jehovah, God of Israel, is its inheritance, as He hath spoken to it.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Moses giveth to the tribe of the sons of Reuben, for their families;</p>
