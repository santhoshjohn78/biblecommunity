<h2>Jeremiah 19</h2>

<p><a id="c19_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Thus said Jehovah, `Go, and thou hast got a potter's earthen vessel, and of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests,</p>

<p><a id="c19_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and thou hast gone forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, that [is] at the opening of the gate of the pottery, and hast proclaimed there the words that I speak unto thee,</p>

<p><a id="c19_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and hast said, Hear a word of Jehovah, ye kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem, Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: `Lo, I am bringing in evil on this place, at which the ears of every one who is hearing it do tingle,</p>

<p><a id="c19_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> because that they have forsaken Me, and make known this place, and make perfume in it to other gods, that they knew not, they and their fathers, and the kings of Judah, and they have filled this place [with] innocent blood,</p>

<p><a id="c19_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons with fire, burnt-offerings to Baal, that I commanded not, nor spake of, nor did it come up on My heart.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> `Therefore, lo, days are coming--an affirmation of Jehovah--and this place is not called any more, Tophet, and Valley of the son of Hinnom, but, Valley of slaughter.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I have made void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and have caused them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those seeking their life, and I have given their carcase for food to the fowl of the heavens, and to the beast of the earth,</p>

<p><a id="c19_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and I have made this city for a desolation, and for a hissing, every passer by it is astonished, and doth hiss for all its plagues.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And I have caused them to eat the flesh of their sons, and the flesh of their daughters, and each the flesh of his friend they do eat, in the siege and in the straitness with which straiten them do their enemies, and those seeking their life.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> `And thou hast broken the bottle before the eyes of the men who are going with thee,</p>

<p><a id="c19_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and hast said unto them: Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, Thus do I break this people and this city, as one breaketh the potter's vessel, that is not able to be repaired again, and in Tophet they bury--without place to bury;</p>

<p><a id="c19_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> so I do to this place--an affirmation of Jehovah--and to its inhabitants, so as to make this city as Tophet;</p>

<p><a id="c19_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, have been--as the place of Tophet--defiled, even all the houses on whose roofs they have made perfume to all the host of the heavens, so as to pour out oblations to other gods.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Jeremiah cometh in from Tophet, whither Jehovah had sent him to prophesy, and he standeth in the court of the house of Jehovah, and he saith unto all the people:</p>

<p><a id="c19_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> `Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I am bringing in unto this city, and on all its cities, all the evil that I have spoken against it, for they have hardened their neck--not to hear My words!'</p>
