<h2>Ephesians 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Call upon you, then, do I--the prisoner of the Lord--to walk worthily of the calling with which ye were called,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of the peace;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> one body and one Spirit, according as also ye were called in one hope of your calling;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> one God and Father of all, who [is] over all, and through all, and in you all,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and to each one of you was given the grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> wherefore, he saith, `Having gone up on high he led captive captivity, and gave gifts to men,' --</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and that, he went up, what is it except that he also went down first to the lower parts of the earth?</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> he who went down is the same also who went up far above all the heavens, that He may fill all things--</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and He gave some [as] apostles, and some [as] prophets, and some [as] proclaimers of good news, and some [as] shepherds and teachers,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> unto the perfecting of the saints, for a work of ministration, for a building up of the body of the Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> till we may all come to the unity of the faith and of the recognition of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to a measure of stature of the fulness of the Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> that we may no more be babes, tossed and borne about by every wind of the teaching, in the sleight of men, in craftiness, unto the artifice of leading astray,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and, being true in love, we may increase to Him [in] all things, who is the head-- the Christ;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> from whom the whole body, being fitly joined together and united, through the supply of every joint, according to the working in the measure of each single part, the increase of the body doth make for the building up of itself in love.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> This, then, I say, and I testify in the Lord; ye are no more to walk, as also the other nations walk, in the vanity of their mind,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> being darkened in the understanding, being alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> who, having ceased to feel, themselves did give up to the lasciviousness, for the working of all uncleanness in greediness;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and ye did not so learn the Christ,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> if so be ye did hear him, and in him were taught, as truth is in Jesus;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> ye are to put off concerning the former behaviour the old man, that is corrupt according to the desires of the deceit,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and to put on the new man, which, according to God, was created in righteousness and kindness of the truth.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Wherefore, putting away the lying, speak truth each with his neighbour, because we are members one of another;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> be angry and do not sin; let not the sun go down upon your wrath,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> neither give place to the devil;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> whoso is stealing let him no more steal, but rather let him labour, working the thing that is good with the hands, that he may have to impart to him having need.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Let no corrupt word out of your mouth go forth, but what is good unto the needful building up, that it may give grace to the hearers;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and make not sorrowful the Holy Spirit of God, in which ye were sealed to a day of redemption.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and become one to another kind, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, according as also God in Christ did forgive you.</p>
