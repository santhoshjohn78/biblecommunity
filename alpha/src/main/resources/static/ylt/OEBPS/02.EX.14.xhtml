<h2>Exodus 14</h2>

<p><a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and they turn back and encamp before Pi-Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-Zephon; over-against it ye do encamp by the sea,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and Pharaoh hath said of the sons of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut upon them;</p>

<p><a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and I have strengthened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hath pursued after them, and I am honoured on Pharaoh, and on all his force, and the Egyptians have known that I [am] Jehovah;' and they do so.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And it is declared to the king of Egypt that the people hath fled, and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants is turned against the people, and they say, `What [is] this we have done? that we have sent Israel away from our service.'</p>

<p><a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he harnesseth his chariot, and his people he hath taken with him,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and he taketh six hundred chosen chariots, even all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over them all;</p>

<p><a id="c14_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and Jehovah strengtheneth the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursueth after the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel are going out with a high hand,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and the Egyptians pursue after them, and all the chariot horses of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his force, overtake them, encamping by the sea, by Pi-Hahiroth, before Baal- Zephon.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Pharaoh hath drawn near, and the sons of Israel lift up their eyes, and lo, the Egyptians are journeying after them, and they fear exceedingly, and the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And they say unto Moses, `Because there are no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in a wilderness? what is this thou hast done to us--to bring us out from Egypt?</p>

<p><a id="c14_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Is not this the word which we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Cease from us, and we serve the Egyptians; for better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in a wilderness?'</p>

<p><a id="c14_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Moses saith unto the people, `Fear not, station yourselves, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which He doth for you to-day; for, as ye have seen the Egyptians to-day, ye add no more to see them--to the age;</p>

<p><a id="c14_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Jehovah doth fight for you, and ye keep silent.'</p>

<p><a id="c14_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `What? thou criest unto Me--speak unto the sons of Israel, and they journey;</p>

<p><a id="c14_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and thou, lift up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand towards the sea, and cleave it, and the sons of Israel go into the midst of the sea on dry land.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> `And I--lo, I am strengthening the heart of the Egyptians, and they go in after them, and I am honoured on Pharaoh, and on all his force, on his chariots, and on his horsemen;</p>

<p><a id="c14_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and the Egyptians have known that I [am] Jehovah, in My being honoured on Pharaoh, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.'</p>

<p><a id="c14_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And the messenger of God, who is going before the camp of Israel, journeyeth and goeth at their rear; and the pillar of the cloud journeyeth from their front, and standeth at their rear,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and cometh in between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel, and the cloud and the darkness are, and he enlighteneth the night, and the one hath not drawn near unto the other all the night.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Moses stretcheth out his hand towards the sea, and Jehovah causeth the sea to go on by a strong east wind all the night, and maketh the sea become dry ground, and the waters are cleaved,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and the sons of Israel go into the midst of the sea, on dry land, and the waters [are] to them a wall, on their right and on their left.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And the Egyptians pursue, and go in after them (all the horses of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen) unto the midst of the sea,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and it cometh to pass, in the morning watch, that Jehovah looketh unto the camp of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubleth the camp of the Egyptians,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and turneth aside the wheels of their chariots, and they lead them with difficulty, and the Egyptians say, `Let us flee from the face of Israel, for Jehovah is fighting for them against the Egyptians.'</p>

<p><a id="c14_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Stretch out thy hand toward the sea, and the waters turn back on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.'</p>

<p><a id="c14_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And Moses stretcheth out his hand towards the sea, and the sea turneth back, at the turning of the morning, to its perennial flow, and the Egyptians are fleeing at its coming, and Jehovah shaketh off the Egyptians in the midst of the sea,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and the waters turn back, and cover the chariots and the horsemen, even all the force of Pharaoh, who are coming in after them into the sea--there hath not been left of them even one.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And the sons of Israel have gone on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters [are] to them a wall, on their right and on their left;</p>

<p><a id="c14_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and Jehovah saveth Israel in that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel seeth the Egyptians dead on the sea-shore,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and Israel seeth the great hand with which Jehovah hath wrought against the Egyptians, and the people fear Jehovah, and remain stedfast in Jehovah, and in Moses His servant.</p>
