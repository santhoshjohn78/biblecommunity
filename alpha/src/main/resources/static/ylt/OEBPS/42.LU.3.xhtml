<h2>Luke 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar--Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother, tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene--</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests--there came a word of God unto John the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and he came to all the region round the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of reformation--to remission of sins,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> as it hath been written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, `A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight make ye His paths;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straightness, and the rough become smooth ways;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Then said he to the multitudes coming forth to be baptised by him, `Brood of vipers! who did prompt you to flee from the coming wrath?</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> make, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have a father--Abraham; for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and already also the axe unto the root of the trees is laid, every tree, therefore, not making good fruit is cut down, and to fire it is cast.'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the multitudes were questioning him, saying, `What, then, shall we do?'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and he answering saith to them, `He having two coats--let him impart to him having none, and he having victuals--in like manner let him do.'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And there came also tax-gatherers to be baptised, and they said unto him, `Teacher, what shall we do?'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and he said unto them, `Exact no more than that directed you.'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And questioning him also were those warring, saying, `And we, what shall we do?' and he said unto them, `Do violence to no one, nor accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the people are looking forward, and all are reasoning in their hearts concerning</p>

<p><a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> John answered, saying to all, `I indeed with water do baptise you, but he cometh who is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to loose the latchet of his sandals--he shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> whose winnowing shovel [is] in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather the wheat to his storehouse, and the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And, therefore, indeed with many other things, exhorting, he was proclaiming good news to the people,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him concerning Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, and concerning all the evils that Herod did,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> added also this to all, that he shut up John in the prison.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And it came to pass, in all the people being baptised, Jesus also being baptised, and praying, the heaven was opened,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and the Holy Spirit came down in a bodily appearance, as if a dove, upon him, and a voice came out of heaven, saying, `Thou art My Son--the Beloved, in thee I did delight.'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years of age, being, as was supposed, son of Joseph,</p>
