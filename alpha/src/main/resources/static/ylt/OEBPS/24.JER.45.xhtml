<h2>Jeremiah 45</h2>

<p><a id="c45_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The word that Jeremiah the prophet hath spoken unto Baruch son of Neriah, in his writing these words on a book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c45_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, concerning thee, O Baruch:</p>

<p><a id="c45_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> `Thou hast said, Woe to me, now, for Jehovah hath added sorrow to my pain, I have been wearied with my sighing, and rest I have not found.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thus dost thou say unto him: Thus said Jehovah: Lo, that which I have built I am throwing down, and that which I have planted I am plucking up, even the whole land itself.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And thou--thou seekest for thee great things--do not seek, for lo, I am bringing in evil on all flesh--an affirmation of Jehovah--and I have given to thee thy life for a spoil, in all places whither thou goest.'</p>
