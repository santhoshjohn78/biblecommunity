<h2>Revelation 14</h2>

<p><a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I saw, and lo, a Lamb having stood upon the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousands, having the name of his Father written upon their foreheads;</p>

<p><a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and I heard a voice out of the heaven, as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of great thunder, and a voice I heard of harpers harping with their harps,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and they sing, as it were, a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders, and no one was able to learn the song except the hundred forty-four thousands, who have been bought from the earth;</p>

<p><a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> these are they who with women were not defiled, for they are virgin; these are they who are following the Lamb whithersoever he may go; these were bought from among men--a first-fruit to God and to the Lamb--</p>

<p><a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and in their mouth there was not found guile, for unblemished are they before the throne of God.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I saw another messenger flying in mid-heaven, having good news age-during to proclaim to those dwelling upon the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> saying in a great voice, `Fear ye God, and give to Him glory, because come did the hour of His judgment, and bow ye before Him who did make the heaven, and the land, and sea, and fountains of waters.'</p>

<p><a id="c14_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And another messenger did follow, saying, `Fall, fall, did Babylon, the great city, because of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom she hath given to all nations to drink.'</p>

<p><a id="c14_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And a third messenger did follow them, saying in a great voice, `If any one the beast doth bow before, and his image, and doth receive a mark upon his forehead, or upon his hand,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, that hath been mingled unmixed in the cup of His anger, and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy messengers, and before the Lamb,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and the smoke of their torment doth go up to ages of ages; and they have no rest day and night, who are bowing before the beast and his image, also if any doth receive the mark of his name.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Here is endurance of the saints: here [are] those keeping the commands of God, and the faith of Jesus.'</p>

<p><a id="c14_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me, `Write: Happy are the dead who in the Lord are dying from this time!' `Yes, (saith the Spirit,) That they may rest from their labours--and their works do follow them!'</p>

<p><a id="c14_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And I saw, and lo, a white cloud, and upon the cloud [one] sitting like to a son of man, having upon his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle;</p>

<p><a id="c14_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and another messenger did come forth out of the sanctuary crying in a great voice to him who is sitting upon the cloud, `Send forth thy sickle and reap, because come to thee hath the hour of reaping, because ripe hath been the harvest ofthe earth;'</p>

<p><a id="c14_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and he who is sitting upon the cloud did put forth his sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And another messenger did come forth out of the sanctuary that [is] in the heaven, having--he also--a sharp sickle,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and another messenger did come forth out from the altar, having authority over the fire, and he called with a great cry to him having the sharp sickle, saying, `Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, because come to perfection have her grapes;'</p>

<p><a id="c14_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and the messenger did put forth his sickle to the earth, and did gather the vine of the earth, and did cast [it] to the great wine-press of the wrath of God;</p>

<p><a id="c14_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and trodden was the wine-press outside of the city, and blood did come forth out of the wine-press--unto the bridles of the horses, a thousand, six hundred furlongs.</p>
