<h2>1 Kings 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Elijah the Tishbite, of the inhabitants of Gilead, saith unto Ahab, `Jehovah, God of Israel, liveth, before whom I have stood, there is not these years dew and rain, except according to my word.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And the word of Jehovah is unto him, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> `Go from this [place]; and thou hast turned for thee eastward, and been hidden by the brook Cherith, that [is] on the front of the Jordan,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and it hath been, from the brook thou dost drink, and the ravens I have commanded to sustain thee there.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And he goeth and doth according to the word of Jehovah, yea, he goeth and dwelleth by the brook Cherith, that [is] on the front of the Jordan,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and the ravens are bringing to him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening, and of the brook he drinketh.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And it cometh to pass, at the end of days, that the brook drieth up, for there hath been no rain in the land,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and the word of Jehovah is unto him, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> `Rise, go to Zarephath, that [is] to Zidon, and thou hast dwelt there; lo, I have commanded there a widow woman to sustain thee.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he riseth, and goeth to Zarephath, and cometh in unto the opening of the city, and lo there, a widow woman gathering sticks, and he calleth unto her, and saith, `Bring, I pray thee, to me, a little water in a vessel, and I drink.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And she goeth to bring [it], and he calleth unto her and saith, `Bring, I pray thee, to me a morsel of bread in thy hand.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And she saith, `Jehovah thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but the fulness of the hand of meal in a pitcher, and a little oil in a dish; and lo, I am gathering two sticks, and have gone in and prepared it for myself, and for my son, and we have eaten it--and died.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Elijah saith unto her, `Fear not, go, do according to thy word, only make for me thence a little cake, in the first place, and thou hast brought out to me; and for thee and for thy son make--last;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> for thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, The pitcher of meal is not consumed, and the dish of oil is not lacking, till the day of Jehovah's giving a shower on the face of the ground.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And she goeth, and doth according to the word of Elijah, and she eateth, she and he, and her household--days;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> the pitcher of meal was not consumed, and the dish of oil did not lack, according to the word of Jehovah that He spake by the hand of Elijah.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And it cometh to pass, after these things, the son of the woman, mistress of the house, hath been sick, and his sickness is very severe till that no breath hath been left in him.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And she saith unto Elijah, `What--to me and to thee, O man of God? thou hast come unto me to cause mine iniquity to be remembered, and to put my son to death!'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And he saith unto her, `Give to me thy son;' and he taketh him out of her bosom, and taketh him up unto the upper chamber where he is abiding, and layeth him on his own bed,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and crieth unto Jehovah, and saith, `Jehovah my God, also on the widow with whom I am sojourning hast Thou done evil--to put her son to death?'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And he stretcheth himself out on the lad three times, and calleth unto Jehovah, and saith, `O Jehovah my God, let turn back, I pray Thee, the soul of this lad into his midst;'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and Jehovah hearkeneth to the voice of Elijah, and the soul of the lad turneth back into his midst, and he liveth.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Elijah taketh the lad, and bringeth him down from the upper chamber of the house, and giveth him to his mother, and Elijah saith, `See, thy son liveth!'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And the woman saith unto Elijah, `Now, this I have known, that a man of God thou [art], and the word of Jehovah in thy mouth [is] truth.'</p>
