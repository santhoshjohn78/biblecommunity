<h2>1 Samuel 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Nahash the Ammonite cometh up, and encampeth against Jabesh-Gilead, and all the men of Jabesh say unto Nahash, `Make with us a covenant, and we serve thee.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Nahash the Ammonite saith unto them, `For this I covenant with you, by picking out to you every right eye--and I have put it a reproach on all Israel.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the elders of Jabesh say to him, `Let us alone seven days, and we send messengers into all the border of Israel: and if there is none saving us--then we have come out unto thee.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the messengers come to Gibeah of Saul, and speak the words in the ears of the people, and all the people lift up their voice and weep;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and lo, Saul hath come after the herd out of the field, and Saul saith, `What--to the people, that they weep?' and they recount to him the words of the men of Jabesh.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the Spirit of God doth prosper over Saul, in his hearing these words, and his anger burneth greatly,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and he taketh a couple of oxen, and cutteth them in pieces, and sendeth through all the border of Israel, by the hand of the messengers, saying, `He who is not coming out after Saul and after Samuel--thus it is done to his oxen;' and the fear of Jehovah falleth on the people, and they come out as one man.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he inspecteth them in Bezek, and the sons of Israel are three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And they say to the messengers who are coming, `Thus do ye say to the men of Jabesh-Gilead: To-morrow ye have safety--by the heat of the sun;' and the messengers come and declare to the men of Jabesh, and they rejoice;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and the men of Jabesh say [to the Ammonites], `To-morrow we come out unto you, and ye have done to us according to all that [is] good in your eyes.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And it cometh to pass, on the morrow, that Saul putteth the people in three detachments, and they come into the midst of the camp in the morning-watch, and smite Ammon till the heat of the day; and it cometh to pass that those left are scattered, and there have not been left of them two together.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the people say unto Samuel, `Who is he that saith, Saul doth reign over us! give ye up the men, and we put them to death.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Saul saith, `There is no man put to death on this day, for to-day hath Jehovah wrought salvation in Israel.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Samuel saith unto the people, `Come and we go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there;'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and all the people go to Gilgal, and cause Saul to reign there before Jehovah in Gilgal, and sacrifice there sacrifices of peace-offerings before Jehovah, and there Saul rejoiceth-- and all the men of Israel--very greatly.</p>
