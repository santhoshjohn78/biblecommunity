<h2>John 9</h2>

<p><a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And passing by, he saw a man blind from birth,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and his disciples asked him, saying, `Rabbi, who did sin, this one or his parents, that he should be born blind?'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jesus answered, `Neither did this one sin nor his parents, but that the works of God may be manifested in him;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> it behoveth me to be working the works of Him who sent me while it is day; night doth come, when no one is able to work: --</p>

<p><a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> when I am in the world, I am a light of the world.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> These things saying, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and rubbed the clay on the eyes of the blind man, and said to him,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `Go away, wash at the pool of Siloam,' which is, interpreted, Sent. He went away, therefore, and did wash, and came seeing;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> the neighbours, therefore, and those seeing him before, that he was blind, said, `Is not this he who is sitting and begging?'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> others said--`This is he;' and others--`He is like to him;' he himself said, --`I am [he].'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> They said, therefore, to him, `How were thine eyes opened?'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> he answered and said, `A man called Jesus made clay, and rubbed my eyes, and said to me, Go away to the pool of Siloam, and wash; and having gone away and having washed, I received sight;'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> they said, therefore, to him, `Where is that one?' he saith, `I have not known.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> They bring him to the Pharisees who once [was] blind,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Again, therefore, the Pharisees also were asking him how he received sight, and he said to them, `Clay he did put upon my eyes, and I did wash--and I see.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Of the Pharisees, therefore, certain said, `This man is not from God, because the sabbath he doth not keep;' others said, `How is a man--a sinful one--able to do such signs?' and there was a division among them.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> They said to the blind man again, `Thou--what dost thou say of him--that he opened thine eyes?'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and he said--`He is a prophet.' The Jews, therefore, did not believe concerning him that he was blind and did receive sight, till that they called the parents of him who received sight,</p>

<p><a id="c9_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and they asked them, saying, `Is your son, of whom ye say that he was born blind? how then now doth he see?'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> His parents answered them and said, `We have known that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and how he now seeth, we have not known; or who opened his eyes, we have not known; himself is of age, ask him; he himself shall speak concerning himself.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> These things said his parents, because they were afraid of the Jews, for already had the Jews agreed together, that if any one may confess him--Christ, he may be put out of the synagogue;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> because of this his parents said--`He is of age, ask him.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> They called, therefore, a second time the man who was blind, and they said to him, `Give glory to God, we have known that this man is a sinner;'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> he answered, therefore, and said, `If he be a sinner--I have not known, one thing I have known, that, being blind, now I see.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And they said to him again, `What did he to thee? how did he open thine eyes?'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> He answered them, `I told you already, and ye did not hear; why again do ye wish to hear? do ye also wish to become his disciples?'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> They reviled him, therefore, and said, `Thou art his disciple, and we are Moses' disciples;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> we have known that God hath spoken to Moses, but this one--we have not known whence he is.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> The man answered and said to them, `Why, in this is a wonderful thing, that ye have not known whence he is, and he opened my eyes!</p>

<p><a id="c9_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> and we have known that God doth not hear sinners, but, if any one may be a worshipper of God, and may do His will, him He doth hear;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> from the age it was not heard, that any one did open eyes of one who hath been born blind;</p>

<p><a id="c9_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> if this one were not from God, he were not able to do anything.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> They answered and said to him, `In sins thou wast born altogether, and thou dost teach us!' and they cast him forth without.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> Jesus heard that they cast him forth without, and having found him, he said to him, `Dost thou believe in the Son of God?'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> he answered and said, `Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And Jesus said to him, `Thou hast both seen him, and he who is speaking with thee is he;'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and he said, `I believe, sir,' and bowed before him.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And Jesus said, `For judgment I to this world did come, that those not seeing may see, and those seeing may become blind.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him, `Are we also blind?'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> Jesus said to them, `If ye were blind, ye were not having had sin, but now ye say--We see, therefore doth your sin remain.</p>
