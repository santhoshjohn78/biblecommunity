<h2>Numbers 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Take up the sum of the sons of Kohath from the midst of the sons of Levi, by their families, by the house of their fathers;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> from a son of thirty years and upward, even till a son of fifty years, every one going in to the host, to do work in the tent of meeting.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> `This [is] the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, the holy of holies:</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> that Aaron and his sons have come in, in the journeying of the camp, and have taken down the vail of the hanging, and have covered with it the ark of the testimony;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and have put on it a covering of badger skin, and have spread a garment completely of blue above, and have placed its staves.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `And on the table of the presence they spread a garment of blue, and have put on it the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and the cups of the libation, and the bread of continuity is on it,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and they have spread over them a garment of scarlet, and have covered it with a covering of badger skin, and have placed its staves,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and have taken a garment of blue, and have covered the candlestick of the lamp, and its lights, and its snuffers, and its snuff-dishes, and all its oil vessels wherewith they minister to it;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and they have put it and all its vessels unto a covering of badger skin, and have put [it] on the bar.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> `And on the golden altar they spread a garment of blue, and have covered it with a covering of badger skin, and have placed its staves;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and have taken all the vessels of ministry wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and have put [them] unto a garment of blue, and have covered them with a covering of badger skin, and have put [them] on the bar,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and have removed the ashes of the altar, and have spread over it a garment of purple;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and have put on it all its vessels wherewith they minister about it, the censers, the hooks, and the shovels, and the bowls, all the vessels of the altar, and have spread on it a covering of badger skin, and have placed its staves:</p>

<p><a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> `And Aaron hath finished--his sons also--covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, in the journeying of the camp, and afterwards do the sons of Kohath come in to bear [it], and they do not come unto the holy thing, that they have died; these [things are] the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> `And the oversight of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, [is] the oil of the lamp, and the spice-perfume, and the present of continuity, and the anointing oil, the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that [is] in it, in the sanctuary,and in its vessels.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> `Ye do not cut off the tribe of the families of the Kohathite from the midst of the Levites;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> but this do to them, and they have lived, and do not die in their drawing nigh the holy of holies: --Aaron and his sons go in, and have set them, each man to his service, and unto his burden,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and they go not in to see when the holy thing is swallowed, that they have died.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> `Take up the sum of the sons of Gershon also by the house of their fathers, by their families;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> from a son of thirty years and upward, till a son of fifty years thou dost number them, every one who is going in to serve the host, to do the service in the tent of meeting.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and they have borne the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tent of meeting, its covering, and the covering of the badger [skin] which [is] on it above, and the vail at the opening of the tent of meeting,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and the hangings of the court, and the vail at the opening of the gate of the court which [is] by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the vessels of their service, and all that is made for them--and they have served.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> `By the command of Aaron and his sons is all the service of the sons of the Gershonite in all their burden, and in all their service; and ye have laid a charge on them concerning the charge of all their burden.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> This [is] the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonite in the tent of meeting; and their charge [is] under the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.</p>
