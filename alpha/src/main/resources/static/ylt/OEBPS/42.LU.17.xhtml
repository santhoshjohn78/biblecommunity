<h2>Luke 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And he said unto the disciples, `It is impossible for the stumbling blocks not to come, but woe [to him] through whom they come;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> it is more profitable to him if a weighty millstone is put round about his neck, and he hath been cast into the sea, than that he may cause one of these little ones to stumble.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> `Take heed to yourselves, and, if thy brother may sin in regard to thee, rebuke him, and if he may reform, forgive him,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and if seven times in the day he may sin against thee, and seven times in the day may turn back to thee, saying, I reform; thou shalt forgive him.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the apostles said to the Lord, `Add to us faith;'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and the Lord said, `If ye had faith as a grain of mustard, ye would have said to this sycamine, Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed you.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> `But, who is he of you--having a servant ploughing or feeding--who, to him having come in out of the field, will say, Having come near, recline at meat?</p>

<p><a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> but will not [rather] say to him, Prepare what I may sup, and having girded thyself about, minister to me, till I eat and drink, and after these things thou shalt eat and drink?</p>

<p><a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Hath he favour to that servant because he did the things directed? I think not.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> `So also ye, when ye may have done all the things directed you, say--We are unprofitable servants, because that which we owed to do--we have done.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And it came to pass, in his going on to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and he entering into a certain village, there met him ten leprous men, who stood afar off,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and they lifted up the voice, saying, `Jesus, master, deal kindly with us;'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and having seen [them], he said to them, `Having gone on, shew yourselves to the priests;' and it came to pass, in their going, they were cleansed,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and one of them having seen that he was healed did turn back, with a loud voice glorifying God,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and he fell upon [his] face at his feet, giving thanks to him, and he was a Samaritan.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Jesus answering said, `Were not the ten cleansed, and the nine--where?</p>

<p><a id="c17_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> There were not found who did turn back to give glory to God, except this alien;'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and he said to him, `Having risen, be going on, thy faith hath saved thee.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And having been questioned by the Pharisees, when the reign of God doth come, he answered them, and said, `The reign of God doth not come with observation;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> nor shall they say, Lo, here; or lo, there; for lo, the reign of God is within you.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And he said unto his disciples, `Days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and ye shall not behold [it];</p>

<p><a id="c17_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and they shall say to you, Lo, here; or lo, there; ye may not go away, nor follow;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> for as the lightning that is lightening out of the one [part] under heaven, to the other part under heaven doth shine, so shall be also the Son of Man in his day;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> and first it behoveth him to suffer many things, and to be rejected by this generation.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> `And, as it came to pass in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were given in marriage, till the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the deluge came, and destroyed all;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> in like manner also, as it came to pass in the days of Lot; they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and on the day Lot went forth from Sodom, He rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed all.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> `According to these things it shall be, in the day the Son of Man is revealed;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> in that day, he who shall be on the house top, and his vessels in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and he in the field, in like manner, let him not turn backward;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> remember the wife of Lot.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Whoever may seek to save his life, shall lose it; and whoever may lose it, shall preserve it.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> `I say to you, In that night, there shall be two men on one couch, the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> two women shall be grinding at the same place together, the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> two men shall be in the field, the one shall be taken, and the other left.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And they answering say to him, `Where, sir?' and he said to them, `Where the body [is], there will the eagles be gathered together.'</p>
