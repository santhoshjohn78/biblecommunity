<h2>Romans 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I call upon you, therefore, brethren, through the compassions of God, to present your bodies a sacrifice--living, sanctified, acceptable to God--your intelligent service;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and be not conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, for your proving what [is] the will of God--the good, and acceptable, and perfect.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For I say, through the grace that was given to me, to every one who is among you, not to think above what it behoveth to think; but to think so as to think wisely, as to each God did deal a measure of faith,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> for as in one body we have many members, and all the members have not the same office,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> so we, the many, one body are in Christ, and members each one of one another.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And having gifts, different according to the grace that was given to us; whether prophecy--`According to the proportion of faith!'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> or ministration--`In the ministration!' or he who is teaching--`In the teaching!'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> or he who is exhorting--`In the exhortation!' he who is sharing--`In simplicity!' he who is leading--`In diligence?' he who is doing kindness--`In cheerfulness.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The love unfeigned: abhorring the evil; cleaving to the good;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> in the love of brethren, to one another kindly affectioned: in the honour going before one another;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> in the diligence not slothful; in the spirit fervent; the Lord serving;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> in the hope rejoicing; in the tribulation enduring; in the prayer persevering;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> to the necessities of the saints communicating; the hospitality pursuing.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Bless those persecuting you; bless, and curse not;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> to rejoice with the rejoicing, and to weep with the weeping,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> of the same mind one toward another, not minding the high things, but with the lowly going along; become not wise in your own conceit;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> giving back to no one evil for evil; providing right things before all men.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> If possible--so far as in you--with all men being in peace;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to the wrath, for it hath been written, `Vengeance [is] Mine,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> I will recompense again, saith the Lord;' if, then, thine enemy doth hunger, feed him; if he doth thirst, give him drink; for this doing, coals of fire thou shalt heap upon his head;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Be not overcome by the evil, but overcome, in the good, the evil.</p>
