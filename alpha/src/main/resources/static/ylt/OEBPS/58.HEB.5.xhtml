<h2>Hebrews 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For every chief priest--out of men taken--in behalf of men is set in things [pertaining] to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> able to be gentle to those ignorant and going astray, since himself also is compassed with infirmity;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and because of this infirmity he ought, as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins;</p>

<p><a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and no one to himself doth take the honour, but he who is called by God, as also Aaron:</p>

<p><a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief priest, but He who spake unto him: `My Son thou art, I to-day have begotten thee;'</p>

<p><a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> as also in another [place] He saith, `Thou [art] a priest--to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'</p>

<p><a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> who in the days of his flesh both prayers and supplications unto Him who was able to save him from death--with strong crying and tears--having offered up, and having been heard in respect to that which he feared,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> through being a Son, did learn by the things which he suffered--the obedience,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and having been made perfect, he did become to all those obeying him a cause of salvation age-during,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> having been addressed by God a chief priest, according to the order of Melchisedek,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard explanation to say, since ye have become dull of hearing,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> for even owing to be teachers, because of the time, again ye have need that one teach you what [are] the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and ye have become having need of milk, and not of strong food,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> for every one who is partaking of milk [is] unskilled in the word of righteousness-- for he is an infant,</p>

<p><a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and of perfect men is the strong food, who because of the use are having the senses exercised, unto the discernment both of good and of evil.</p>
