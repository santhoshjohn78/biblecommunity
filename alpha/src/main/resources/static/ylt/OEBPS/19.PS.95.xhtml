<h2>Psalms 95</h2>

<p><a id="c95_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Come, we sing to Jehovah, We shout to the rock of our salvation.</p>

<p><a id="c95_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> We come before His face with thanksgiving, With psalms we shout to Him.</p>

<p><a id="c95_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For a great God [is] Jehovah, And a great king over all gods.</p>

<p><a id="c95_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> In whose hand [are] the deep places of earth, And the strong places of hills [are] His.</p>

<p><a id="c95_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Whose is the sea, and He made it, And His hands formed the dry land.</p>

<p><a id="c95_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Come in, we bow ourselves, and we bend, We kneel before Jehovah our Maker.</p>

<p><a id="c95_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For He [is] our God, and we the people of His pasture, And the flock of His hand, Today, if to His voice ye hearken,</p>

<p><a id="c95_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Harden not your heart as [in] Meribah, As [in] the day of Massah in the wilderness,</p>

<p><a id="c95_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Where your fathers have tried Me, Have proved Me, yea, have seen My work.</p>

<p><a id="c95_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Forty years I am weary of the generation, And I say, `A people erring in heart--they! And they have not known My ways:'</p>

<p><a id="c95_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Where I sware in Mine anger, `If they come in unto My rest--!'</p>
