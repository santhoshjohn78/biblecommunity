<h2>1 Corinthians 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly--as to babes in Christ;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> with milk I fed you, and not with meat, for ye were not yet able, but not even yet are ye now able,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> for yet ye are fleshly, for where [there is] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not fleshly, and in the manner of men do walk?</p>

<p><a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> for when one may say, `I, indeed, am of Paul;' and another, `I--of Apollos;' are ye not fleshly?</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Who, then, is Paul, and who Apollos, but ministrants through whom ye did believe, and to each as the Lord gave?</p>

<p><a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I planted, Apollos watered, but God was giving growth;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> so that neither is he who is planting anything, nor he who is watering, but He who is giving growth--God;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and he who is planting and he who is watering are one, and each his own reward shall receive, according to his own labour,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for of God we are fellow-workmen; God's tillage, God's building ye are.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> According to the grace of God that was given to me, as a wise master-builder, a foundation I have laid, and another doth build on [it],</p>

<p><a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> for other foundation no one is able to lay except that which is laid, which is Jesus the Christ;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and if any one doth build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw--</p>

<p><a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> of each the work shall become manifest, for the day shall declare [it], because in fire it is revealed, and the work of each, what kind it is, the fire shall prove;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> if of any one the work doth remain that he built on [it], a wage he shall receive;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> if of any the work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; and himself shall be saved, but so as through fire.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> have ye not known that ye are a sanctuary of God, and the Spirit of God doth dwell in you?</p>

<p><a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> if any one the sanctuary of God doth waste, him shall God waste; for the sanctuary of God is holy, the which ye are.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Let no one deceive himself; if any one doth seem to be wise among you in this age--let him become a fool, that he may become wise,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it hath been written, `Who is taking the wise in their craftiness;'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and again, `The Lord doth know the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.'</p>

<p><a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> So then, let no one glory in men, for all things are yours,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things about to be--all are yours,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and ye [are] Christ's, and Christ [is] God's.</p>
