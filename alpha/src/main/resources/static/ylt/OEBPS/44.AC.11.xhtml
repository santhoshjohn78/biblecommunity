<h2>Acts 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the apostles and the brethren who are in Judea heard that also the nations did receive the word of God,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision were contending with him,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> saying--`Unto men uncircumcised thou didst go in, and didst eat with them!'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Peter having begun, did expound to them in order saying,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> `I was in the city of Joppa praying, and I saw in a trance a vision, a certain vessel coming down, as a great sheet by four corners being let down out of the heaven, and it came unto me;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> at which having looked stedfastly, I was considering, and I saw the four-footed beasts of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the fowls of heaven;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and I heard a voice saying to me, Having risen, Peter, slay and eat;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and I said, Not so, Lord; because anything common or unclean hath at no time entered into my mouth;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and a voice did answer me a second time out of the heaven, What God did cleanse, thou- -declare not thou common.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> `And this happened thrice, and again was all drawn up to the heaven,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and, lo, immediately, three men stood at the house in which I was, having been sent from Caesarea unto me,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and the Spirit said to me to go with them, nothing doubting, and these six brethren also went with me, and we did enter into the house of the man,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> he declared also to us how he saw the messenger in his house standing, and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> who shall speak sayings by which thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> `And in my beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit did fall upon them, even as also upon us in the beginning,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and I remembered the saying of the Lord, how he said, John indeed did baptize with water, and ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> if then the equal gift God did give to them as also to us, having believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, I--how was I able to withstand God?'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And they, having heard these things, were silent, and were glorifying God, saying, `Then, indeed, also to the nations did God give the reformation to life.'</p>

<p><a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Those, indeed, therefore, having been scattered abroad, from the tribulation that came after Stephen, went through unto Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none except to Jews only;</p>

<p><a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and there were certain of them men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who having entered into Antioch, were speaking unto the Hellenists, proclaiming good news--the Lord Jesus,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and the hand of the Lord was with them, a great number also, having believed, did turn unto the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And the account was heard in the ears of the assembly that [is] in Jerusalem concerning them, and they sent forth Barnabas to go through unto Antioch,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> who, having come, and having seen the grace of God, was glad, and was exhorting all with purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> because he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit, and of faith, and a great multitude was added to the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Barnabas went forth to Tarsus, to seek for Saul,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and having found him, he brought him to Antioch, and it came to pass that they a whole year did assemble together in the assembly, and taught a great multitude, the disciples also were divinely called first in Antioch Christians.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And in those days there came from Jerusalem prophets to Antioch,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and one of them, by name Agabus, having stood up, did signify through the Spirit a great dearth is about to be throughout all the world--which also came to pass in the time of Claudius Caesar--</p>

<p><a id="c11_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and the disciples, according as any one was prospering, determined each of them to send for ministration to the brethren dwelling in Judea,</p>

<p><a id="c11_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> which also they did, having sent unto the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</p>
