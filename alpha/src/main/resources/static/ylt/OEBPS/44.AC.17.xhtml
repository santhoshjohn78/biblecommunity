<h2>Acts 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And having passed through Amphipolis, and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and according to the custom of Paul, he went in unto them, and for three sabbaths he was reasoning with them from the Writings,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> opening and alleging, `That the Christ it behoved to suffer, and to rise again out of the dead, and that this is the Christ--Jesus whom I proclaim to you.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And certain of them did believe, and attached themselves to Paul and to Silas, also of the worshipping Greeks a great multitude, of the principal women also not a few.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the unbelieving Jews, having been moved with envy, and having taken to them of the loungers certain evil men, and having made a crowd, were setting the city in an uproar; having assailed also the house of Jason, they were seeking them to bring [them] to the populace,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and not having found them, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the city rulers, calling aloud--`These, having put the world in commotion, are also here present,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying another to be king--Jesus.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And they troubled the multitude and the city rulers, hearing these things,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and having taking security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the brethren immediately, through the night, sent forth both Paul and Silas to Berea, who having come, went to the synagogue of the Jews;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, they received the word with all readiness of mind, every day examining the Writings whether those things were so;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> many, indeed, therefore, of them did believe, and of the honourable Greek women and men not a few.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that also in Berea was the word of God declared by Paul, they came thither also, agitating the multitudes;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul, to go on as it were to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy were remaining there.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And those conducting Paul, brought him unto Athens, and having received a command unto Silas and Timotheus that with all speed they may come unto him, they departed;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and Paul waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, beholding the city wholly given to idolatry,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> therefore, indeed, he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the worshipping persons, and in the market-place every day with those who met with him.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And certain of the Epicurean and of the Stoic philosophers, were meeting together to see him, and some were saying, `What would this seed picker wish to say?' and others, `Of strange demons he doth seem to be an announcer;' because Jesus and the rising again he did proclaim to them as good news,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> having also taken him, unto the Areopagus they brought [him], saying, `Are we able to know what [is] this new teaching that is spoken by thee,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> for certain strange things thou dost bring to our ears? we wish, then, to know what these things would wish to be;'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and all Athenians, and the strangers sojourning, for nothing else were at leisure but to say something, and to hear some newer thing.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Paul, having stood in the midst of the Areopagus, said, `Men, Athenians, in all things I perceive you as over-religious;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> for passing through and contemplating your objects of worship, I found also an erection on which had been inscribed: To God--unknown; whom, therefore--not knowing--ye do worship, this One I announce to you.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> `God, who did make the world, and all things in it, this One, of heaven and of earth being Lord, in temples made with hands doth not dwell,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> neither by the hands of men is He served--needing anything, He giving to all life, and breath, and all things;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> He made also of one blood every nation of men, to dwell upon all the face of the earth-- having ordained times before appointed, and the bounds of their dwellings--</p>

<p><a id="c17_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> to seek the Lord, if perhaps they did feel after Him and find, --though, indeed, He is not far from each one of us,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> for in Him we live, and move, and are; as also certain of your poets have said: For of Him also we are offspring.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> `Being, therefore, offspring of God, we ought not to think the Godhead to be like to gold, or silver, or stone, graving of art and device of man;</p>

<p><a id="c17_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> the times, indeed, therefore, of the ignorance God having overlooked, doth now command all men everywhere to reform,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> because He did set a day in which He is about to judge the world in righteousness, by a man whom He did ordain, having given assurance to all, having raised him out of the dead.'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And having heard of a rising again of the dead, some, indeed, were mocking, but others said, `We will hear thee again concerning this;'</p>

<p><a id="c17_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> and so Paul went forth from the midst of them,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> and certain men having cleaved to him, did believe, among whom [is] also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman, by name Damaris, and others with them.</p>
