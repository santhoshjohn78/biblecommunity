<h2>1 Samuel 31</h2>

<p><a id="c31_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the Philistines are fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel flee from the face of the Philistines, and fall wounded in mount Gilboa,</p>

<p><a id="c31_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and the Philistines follow Saul and his sons, and the Philistines smite Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, sons of Saul.</p>

<p><a id="c31_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the battle is hard against Saul, and the archers find him--men with bow--and he is pained greatly by the archers;</p>

<p><a id="c31_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and Saul saith to the bearer of his weapons, `Draw thy sword, and pierce me with it, lest they come--these uncircumcised--and have pierced me, and rolled themselves on me;' and the bearer of his weapons hath not been willing, for he is greatly afraid, and Saul taketh the sword, and falleth upon it.</p>

<p><a id="c31_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the bearer of his weapons seeth that Saul [is] dead, and he falleth--he also--on his sword, and dieth with him;</p>

<p><a id="c31_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and Saul dieth, and three of his sons, and the bearer of his weapons, also all his men, on that day together.</p>

<p><a id="c31_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And they see--the men of Israel, who [are] beyond the valley, and who [are] beyond the Jordan--that the men of Israel have fled, and that Saul and his sons have died, and they forsake the cities and flee, and Philistines come in, and dwell in them.</p>

<p><a id="c31_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And it cometh to pass on the morrow, that the Philistines come to strip the wounded, and they find Saul and his three sons fallen on mount Gilboa,</p>

<p><a id="c31_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and they cut off his head, and strip off his weapons, and send into the land of the Philistines round about, to proclaim tidings [in] the house of their idols, and [among] the people;</p>

<p><a id="c31_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and they place his weapons [in] the house of Ashtaroth, and his body they have fixed on the wall of Beth-Shan.</p>

<p><a id="c31_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And they hear regarding it--the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead--that which the Philistines have done to Saul,</p>

<p><a id="c31_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and all the men of valour arise, and go all the night, and take the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, from the wall of Beth-Shan, and come in to Jabesh, and burn them there,</p>

<p><a id="c31_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and they take their bones, and bury [them] under the tamarisk in Jabesh, and fast seven days.</p>
