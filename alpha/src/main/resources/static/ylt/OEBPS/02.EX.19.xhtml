<h2>Exodus 19</h2>

<p><a id="c19_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In the third month of the going out of the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, in this day they have come into the wilderness of Sinai,</p>

<p><a id="c19_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and they journey from Rephidim, and enter the wilderness of Sinai, and encamp in the wilderness; and Israel encampeth there before the mount.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Moses hath gone up unto God, and Jehovah calleth unto him out of the mount, saying, `Thus dost thou say to the house of Jacob, and declare to the sons of Israel,</p>

<p><a id="c19_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Ye--ye have seen that which I have done to the Egyptians, and I bear you on eagles' wings, and bring you in unto Myself.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> `And now, if ye really hearken to My voice, then ye have kept My covenant, and been to Me a peculiar treasure more than all the peoples, for all the earth [is] Mine;</p>

<p><a id="c19_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and ye--ye are to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation: these [are] the words which thou dost speak unto the sons of Israel.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Moses cometh, and calleth for the elders of the people, and setteth before them all these words which Jehovah hath commanded him;</p>

<p><a id="c19_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and all the people answer together and say, `All that Jehovah hath spoken we do;' and Moses returneth the words of the people unto Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Lo, I am coming unto thee in the thickness of the cloud, so that the people hear in My speaking with thee, and also believe in thee to the age;' and Moses declareth the words of the people unto Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Go unto the people; and thou hast sanctified them to-day and to-morrow, and they have washed their garments,</p>

<p><a id="c19_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and have been prepared for the third day; for on the third day doth Jehovah come down before the eyes of all the people, on mount Sinai.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> `And thou hast made a border [for] the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, going up into the mount, or coming against its extremity; whoever is coming against the mount is certainly put to death;</p>

<p><a id="c19_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> a hand cometh not against him, for he is certainly stoned or shot through, whether beast or man it liveth not; in the drawing out of the jubilee cornet they go up into the mount.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Moses cometh down from the mount unto the people, and sanctifieth the people, and they wash their garments;</p>

<p><a id="c19_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and he saith unto the people, `Be ye prepared for the third day, come not nigh unto a woman.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And it cometh to pass, on the third day, while it is morning, that there are voices, and lightnings, and a heavy cloud, on the mount, and the sound of a trumpet very strong; and all the people who [are] in the camp do tremble.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Moses bringeth out the people to meet God from the camp, and they station themselves at the lower part of the mount,</p>

<p><a id="c19_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and mount Sinai [is] wholly a smoke from the presence of Jehovah, who hath come down on it in fire, and its smoke goeth up as smoke of the furnace, and the whole mount trembleth exceedingly;</p>

<p><a id="c19_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and the sound of the trumpet is going on, and very strong; Moses speaketh, and God doth answer him with a voice.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Jehovah cometh down on mount Sinai, unto the top of the mount, and Jehovah calleth for Moses unto the top of the mount, and Moses goeth up.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Go down, protest to the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to see, and many of them have fallen;</p>

<p><a id="c19_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and also the priests who are coming nigh unto Jehovah do sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth on them.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Moses saith unto Jehovah, `The people [is] unable to come up unto mount Sinai, for Thou--Thou hast protested to us, saying, Make a border [for] the mount, then thou hast sanctified it.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Jehovah saith unto him, `Go, descend, then thou hast come up, thou, and Aaron with thee; and the priests and the people do not break through, to come up unto Jehovah, lest He break forth upon them.'</p>

<p><a id="c19_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Moses goeth down unto the people, and saith unto them: --</p>
