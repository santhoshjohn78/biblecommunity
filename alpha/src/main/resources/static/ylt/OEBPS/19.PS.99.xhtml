<h2>Psalms 99</h2>

<p><a id="c99_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah hath reigned, peoples tremble, The Inhabitant of the cherubs, the earth shaketh.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah in Zion [is] great, And high He [is] over all the peoples.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> They praise Thy name, `Great, and fearful, holy [it] is.'</p>

<p><a id="c99_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the strength of the king Hath loved judgment, Thou--Thou hast established uprightness; Judgment and righteousness in Jacob, Thou--Thou hast done.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His footstool, holy [is] He.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Moses and Aaron among His priests, And Samuel among those proclaiming His name. They are calling unto Jehovah, And He doth answer them.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> In a pillar of cloud He speaketh unto them, They have kept His testimonies, And the statute He hath given to them.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> O Jehovah, our God, Thou hast afflicted them, A God forgiving Thou hast been to them, And taking vengeance on their actions.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His holy hill, For holy [is] Jehovah our God!</p>
