<h2>Acts 27</h2>

<p><a id="c27_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And when our sailing to Italy was determined, they were delivering up both Paul and certain others, prisoners, to a centurion, by name Julius, of the band of Sebastus,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and having embarked in a ship of Adramyttium, we, being about to sail by the coasts of Asia, did set sail, there being with us Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> on the next [day] also we touched at Sidon, and Julius, courteously treating Paul, did permit [him], having gone on unto friends, to receive [their] care.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And thence, having set sail, we sailed under Cyprus, because of the winds being contrary,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and having sailed over the sea over-against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myria of Lycia,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria, sailing to Italy, did put us into it,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and having sailed slowly many days, and with difficulty coming over-against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over-against Salmone,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and hardly passing it, we came to a certain place called `Fair Havens,' nigh to which was the city [of] Lasaea.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And much time being spent, and the sailing being now dangerous--because of the fast also being already past--Paul was admonishing,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> saying to them, `Men, I perceive that with hurt, and much damage, not only of the lading and of the ship, but also of our lives--the voyage is about to be;'</p>

<p><a id="c27_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> but the centurion to the pilot and to the shipowner gave credence more than to the things spoken by Paul;</p>

<p><a id="c27_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and the haven being incommodious to winter in, the more part gave counsel to sail thence also, if by any means they might be able, having attained to Phenice, [there] to winter, [which is] a haven of Crete, looking to the south-west and north-west,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and a south wind blowing softly, having thought they had obtained [their] purpose, having lifted anchor, they sailed close by Crete,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, that is called Euroclydon,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and the ship being caught, and not being able to bear up against the wind, having given [her] up, we were borne on,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and having run under a certain little isle, called Clauda, we were hardly able to become masters of the boat,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> which having taken up, they were using helps, undergirding the ship, and fearing lest they may fall on the quicksand, having let down the mast--so were borne on.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And we, being exceedingly tempest-tossed, the succeeding [day] they were making a clearing,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and on the third [day] with our own hands the tackling of the ship we cast out,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and neither sun nor stars appearing for more days, and not a little tempest lying upon us, thenceforth all hope was taken away of our being saved.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And there having been long fasting, then Paul having stood in the midst of them, said, `It behoved [you], indeed, O men--having hearkened to me--not to set sail from Crete, and to save this hurt and damage;</p>

<p><a id="c27_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there shall be no loss of life among you-- but of the ship;</p>

<p><a id="c27_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> for there stood by me this night a messenger of God--whose I am, and whom I serve--</p>

<p><a id="c27_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> saying, Be not afraid Paul; before Caesar it behoveth thee to stand; and, lo, God hath granted to thee all those sailing with thee;</p>

<p><a id="c27_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> wherefore be of good cheer, men! for I believe God, that so it shall be, even as it hath been spoken to me,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and on a certain island it behoveth us to be cast.'</p>

<p><a id="c27_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And when the fourteenth night came--we being borne up and down in the Adria-- toward the middle of the night the sailors were supposing that some country drew nigh to them;</p>

<p><a id="c27_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and having sounded they found twenty fathoms, and having gone a little farther, and again having sounded, they found fifteen fathoms,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and fearing lest on rough places we may fall, out of the stern having cast four anchors, they were wishing day to come.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and having let down the boat to the sea, in pretence as [if] out of the foreship they are about to cast anchors,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, `If these do not remain in the ship--ye are not able to be saved;'</p>

<p><a id="c27_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> then the soldiers did cut off the ropes of the boat, and suffered it to fall off.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And till the day was about to be, Paul was calling upon all to partake of nourishment, saying, `Fourteen days to-day, waiting, ye continue fasting, having taken nothing,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> wherefore I call upon you to take nourishment, for this is for your safety, for of not one of you shall a hair from the head fall;'</p>

<p><a id="c27_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> and having said these things, and having taken bread, he gave thanks to God before all, and having broken [it], he began to eat;</p>

<p><a id="c27_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> and all having become of good cheer, themselves also took food,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> (and we were--all the souls in the ship--two hundred, seventy and six),</p>

<p><a id="c27_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and having eaten sufficient nourishment, they were lightening the ship, casting forth the wheat into the sea.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And when the day came, they were not discerning the land, but a certain creek were perceiving having a beach, into which they took counsel, if possible, to thrust forward the ship,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> and the anchors having taken up, they were committing [it] to the sea, at the same time- -having loosed the bands of the rudders, and having hoisted up the mainsail to the wind--they were making for the shore,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> and having fallen into a place of two seas, they ran the ship aground, and the fore-part, indeed, having stuck fast, did remain immoveable, but the hinder-part was broken by the violence of the waves.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> And the soldiers' counsel was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one having swam out should escape,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, hindered them from the counsel, and did command those able to swim, having cast themselves out first--to get unto the land,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> and the rest, some indeed upon boards, and some upon certain things of the ship; and thus it came to pass that all came safe unto the land.</p>
