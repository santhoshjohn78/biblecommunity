<h2>Psalms 146</h2>

<p><a id="c146_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise ye Jah! Praise, O my soul, Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I praise Jehovah during my life, I sing praise to my God while I exist.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Trust not in princes--in a son of man, For he hath no deliverance.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> His spirit goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, In that day have his thoughts perished.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> O the happiness of him Who hath the God of Jacob for his help, His hope [is] on Jehovah his God,</p>

<p><a id="c146_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Making the heavens and earth, The sea and all that [is] in them, Who is keeping truth to the age,</p>

<p><a id="c146_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Doing judgment for the oppressed, Giving bread to the hungry.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Jehovah is loosing the prisoners, Jehovah is opening (the eyes of) the blind, Jehovah is raising the bowed down, Jehovah is loving the righteous,</p>

<p><a id="c146_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Jehovah is preserving the strangers, The fatherless and widow He causeth to stand, And the way of the wicked He turneth upside down.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Jehovah doth reign to the age, Thy God, O Zion, to generation and generation, Praise ye Jah!</p>
