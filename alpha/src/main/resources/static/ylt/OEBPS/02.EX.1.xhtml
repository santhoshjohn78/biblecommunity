<h2>Exodus 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And these [are] the names of the sons of Israel who are coming into Egypt with Jacob; a man and his household have they come;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And all the persons coming out of the thigh of Jacob are seventy persons; as to Joseph, he was in Egypt.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Joseph dieth, and all his brethren, and all that generation;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and the sons of Israel have been fruitful, and they teem, and multiply, and are very very mighty, and the land is filled with them.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And there riseth a new king over Egypt, who hath not known Joseph,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and he saith unto his people, `Lo, the people of the sons of Israel [is] more numerous and mighty than we;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> give help! let us act wisely concerning it, lest it multiply, and it hath come to pass, when war happeneth, that it hath been joined, even it, unto those hating us, and hath fought against us, and hath gone out up of the land.'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And they set over it princes of tribute, so as to afflict it with their burdens, and it buildeth store-cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and as they afflict it, so it multiplieth, and so it breaketh forth, and they are vexed because of the sons of Israel;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and the Egyptians cause the sons of Israel to serve with rigour,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and make their lives bitter in hard service, in clay, and in brick, and in every [kind] of service in the field; all their service in which they have served [is] with rigour.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the king of Egypt speaketh to the midwives, the Hebrewesses, (of whom the name of the one [is] Shiphrah, and the name of the second Puah),</p>

<p><a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and saith, `When ye cause the Hebrew women to bear, and have looked on the children; if it [is] a son--then ye have put him to death; and if it [is] a daughter--then she hath lived.'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the midwives fear God, and have not done as the king of Egypt hath spoken unto them, and keep the lads alive;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and the king of Egypt calleth for the midwives, and saith to them, `Wherefore have ye done this thing, and keep the lads alive?'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And the midwives say unto Pharaoh, `Because the Hebrew women [are] not as the Egyptian women, for they [are] lively; before the midwife cometh in unto them--they have borne!'</p>

<p><a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And God doth good to the midwives, and the people multiply, and are very mighty;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and it cometh to pass, because the midwives have feared God, that He maketh for them households;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and Pharaoh layeth a charge on all his people, saying, `Every son who is born--into the River ye do cast him, and every daughter ye do keep alive.'</p>
