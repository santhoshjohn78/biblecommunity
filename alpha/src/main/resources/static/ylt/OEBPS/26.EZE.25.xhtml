<h2>Ezekiel 25</h2>

<p><a id="c25_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c25_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> `Son of man, set thy face unto the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against them;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and thou hast said to the sons of Ammon: Hear ye a word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of thy saying, Aha, to My sanctuary, Because it hath been polluted, And unto the ground of Israel, Because it hath been desolate, And unto the house of Judah, Because they have gone into a removal:</p>

<p><a id="c25_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Therefore, lo, I am giving thee to sons of the east for a possession, And they set their towers in thee, And have placed in thee their tabernacles. They eat thy fruit, and they drink thy milk,</p>

<p><a id="c25_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And I have given Rabbah for a habitation of camels, And the sons of Ammon for the crouching of a flock, And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of thy clapping the hand, And of thy stamping with the foot, And thou rejoicest with all thy despite in soul Against the ground of Israel,</p>

<p><a id="c25_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Therefore, lo, I--I have stretched out My hand against thee, And have given thee for a portion to nations, And I have cut thee off from the peoples, And caused thee to perish from the lands; I destroy thee, and thou hast known that I [am] Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of the saying of Moab and Seir: Lo, as all the nations [is] the house of Judah;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Therefore, lo, I am opening the shoulder of Moab--From the cities--from his cities-- from his frontier, The beauty of the land, Beth-Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon, and Kiriathaim,</p>

<p><a id="c25_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> To the sons of the east, with the sons of Ammon, And I have given it for a possession, So that the sons of Ammon are not remembered among nations.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And in Moab I do judgments, And they have known that I [am] Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of the doings of Edom, In taking vengeance on the house of Judah, Yea, they are very guilty, And they have taken vengeance on them.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I have stretched out My hand against Edom, And I have cut off from it man and beast, And given it up--a waste, from Teman even to Dedan, By sword they do fall.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And I have given My vengeance on Edom, By the hand of My people Israel, And they have done in Edom, According to My anger, and according to My fury, And they have known My vengeance, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of the doings of the Philistines in vengeance, And they take vengeance with despite in soul, To destroy--the enmity age-during!</p>

<p><a id="c25_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I am stretching out My hand against the Philistines, And I have cut off the Cherethim, And destroyed the remnant of the haven of the sea,</p>

<p><a id="c25_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And done upon them great vengeance with furious reproofs, And they have known that I [am] Jehovah, In My giving out My vengeance on them!</p>
