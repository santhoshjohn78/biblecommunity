<h2>1 Kings 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Rehoboam goeth to Shechem, for to Shechem hath all Israel come to make him king.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And it cometh to pass, at Jeroboam son of Nebat's hearing (and he [is] yet in Egypt where he hath fled from the presence of Solomon the king, and Jeroboam dwelleth in Egypt),</p>

<p><a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> that they send and call for him; and they come--Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel--and speak unto Rehoboam, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> `Thy father made hard our yoke, and thou, now, make light [some] of the hard service of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we serve thee.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And he saith unto them, `Go--yet three days, and come back unto me;' and the people go.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And king Rehoboam consulteth with the elders who have been standing in the presence of Solomon his father, in his being alive, saying, `How are ye counselling to answer this people?'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And they speak unto him, saying, `If, to-day, thou art servant to this people, and hast served them, and answered them, and spoken unto them good words, then they have been to thee servants all the days.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he forsaketh the counsel of the elders which they counselled him, and consulteth with the lads who have grown up with him, who are standing before him;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and he saith unto them, `What are ye counselling, and we answer this people, who have spoken unto me, saying, Lighten [somewhat] of the yoke that thy father put upon us?'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And they speak unto him--the lads who had grown up with him--saying, `Thus dost thou say to this people who have spoken unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and thou, make [it] light upon us; thus dost thou speak unto them, Mylittle [finger] is thicker than the loins of my father;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and now, my father laid on you a heavy yoke, and I add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, and I--I chastise you with scorpions.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And they come--Jeroboam and all the people--unto Rehoboam, on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, `Come back unto me on the third day.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the king answereth the people sharply, and forsaketh the counsel of the elders which they counselled him,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and speaketh unto them, according to the counsel of the lads, saying, `My father made your yoke heavy, and I add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, and I--I chastise you with scorpions;'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and the king hearkened not unto the people, for the revolution was from Jehovah, in order to establish His word that Jehovah spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam son of Nebat.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And all Israel see that the king hath not hearkened unto them, and the people send the king back word, saying, `What portion have we in David? yea, there is no inheritance in the son of Jesse; to thy tents, O Israel; now see thy house, O David!' and Israel goeth to its tents.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> As to the sons of Israel, those dwelling in the cities of Judah--over them reign doth Rehoboam.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And king Rehoboam sendeth Adoram who [is] over the tribute, and all Israel cast at him stones, and he dieth; and king Rehoboam hath strengthened himself to go up into a chariot to flee to Jerusalem;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and Israel transgresseth against the house of David unto this day.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And it cometh to pass, at all Israel's hearing that Jeroboam hath returned, that they send and call him unto the company, and cause him to reign over all Israel; none hath been after the house of David save the tribe of Judah alone.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Rehoboam cometh to Jerusalem, and assembleth all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen warriors, to fight with the house of Israel, to bring back the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And the word of God is unto Shemaiah a man of God, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> `Speak unto Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Thus said Jehovah, Ye do not go up nor fight with your brethren the sons of Israel; turn back each to his house, for from Me hath this thing been;' and they hear the word of Jehovah, and turn back to go according to the word of Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Jeroboam buildeth Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelleth in it, and goeth out thence, and buildeth Penuel;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and Jeroboam saith in his heart, `Now doth the kingdom turn back to the house of David--</p>

<p><a id="c12_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> if this people go up to make sacrifices in the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, then hath the heart of this people turned back unto their lord, unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they have slain me, and turned back unto Rehoboam king of Judah.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And the king taketh counsel, and maketh two calves of gold, and saith unto them, `Enough to you of going up to Jerusalem; lo, thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.'</p>

<p><a id="c12_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And he setteth the one in Beth-El, and the other he hath put in Dan,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and this thing becometh a sin, and the people go before the one--unto Dan.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And he maketh the house of high places, and maketh priests of the extremities of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi;</p>

<p><a id="c12_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and Jeroboam maketh a festival in the eighth month, in the fifteenth day of the month, like the festival that [is] in Judah, and he offereth on the altar--so did he in Beth-El--to sacrifice to the calves which he made, and he hath appointedin Beth-El the priests of the high places that he made.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And he offereth up on the altar that he made in Beth-El, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month that he devised of his own heart, and he maketh a festival to the sons of Israel, and offereth on the altar--to make perfume.</p>
