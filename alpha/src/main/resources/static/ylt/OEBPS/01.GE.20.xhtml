<h2>Genesis 20</h2>

<p><a id="c20_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Abraham journeyeth from thence toward the land of the south, and dwelleth between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourneth in Gerar;</p>

<p><a id="c20_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and Abraham saith concerning Sarah his wife, `She is my sister;' and Abimelech king of Gerar sendeth and taketh Sarah.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And God cometh in unto Abimelech in a dream of the night, and saith to him, `Lo, thou [art] a dead man, because of the woman whom thou hast taken--and she married to a husband.'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Abimelech hath not drawn near unto her, and he saith, `Lord, also a righteous nation dost thou slay?</p>

<p><a id="c20_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> hath not he himself said to me, She [is] my sister! and she, even she herself, said, He [is] my brother; in the integrity of my heart, and in the innocency of my hands, I have done this.'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And God saith unto him in the dream, `Yea, I--I have known that in the integrity of thy heart thou hast done this, and I withhold thee, even I, from sinning against Me, therefore I have not suffered thee to come against her;</p>

<p><a id="c20_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and now send back the man's wife, for he [is] inspired, and he doth pray for thee, and live thou; and if thou do not send back, know that dying thou dost die, thou, and all that thou hast.'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Abimelech riseth early in the morning, and calleth for all his servants, and speaketh all these words in their ears; and the men fear exceedingly;</p>

<p><a id="c20_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and Abimelech calleth for Abraham, and saith to him, `What hast thou done to us? and what have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought upon me, and upon my kingdom, a great sin? works which are not done thou hast done with me.'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Abimelech also saith unto Abraham, `What hast thou seen that thou hast done this thing?'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Abraham saith, `Because I said, `Surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they have slain me for the sake of my wife;</p>

<p><a id="c20_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and also, truly she is my sister, daughter of my father, only not daughter of my mother, and she becometh my wife;</p>

<p><a id="c20_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and it cometh to pass, when God hath caused me to wander from my father's house, that I say to her, This [is] thy kindness which thou dost with me: at every place whither we come, say of me, He [is] my brother.'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Abimelech taketh sheep and oxen, and servants and handmaids, and giveth to Abraham, and sendeth back to him Sarah his wife;</p>

<p><a id="c20_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and Abimelech saith, `Lo, my land [is] before thee, where it is good in thine eyes, dwell;'</p>

<p><a id="c20_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and to Sarah he hath said, `Lo, I have given a thousand silverlings to thy brother; lo, it is to thee a covering of eyes, to all who are with thee;' and by all this she is reasoned with.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Abraham prayeth unto God, and God healeth Abimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and they bear:</p>

<p><a id="c20_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> for Jehovah restraining had restrained every womb of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.</p>
