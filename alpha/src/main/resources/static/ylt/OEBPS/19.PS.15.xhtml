<h2>Psalms 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of David. Jehovah, who doth sojourn in Thy tent? Who doth dwell in Thy holy hill?</p>

<p><a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> He who is walking uprightly, And working righteousness, And speaking truth in his heart.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He hath not slandered by his tongue, He hath not done to his friend evil; And reproach he hath not lifted up Against his neighbour.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Despised in his eyes [is] a rejected one, And those fearing Jehovah he doth honour. He hath sworn to suffer evil, and changeth not;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> His silver he hath not given in usury, And a bribe against the innocent Hath not taken; Whoso is doing these is not moved to the age!</p>
