<h2>Ruth 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Boaz hath gone up to the gate, and sitteth there, and lo, the redeemer is passing by of whom Boaz had spoken, and he saith, `Turn aside, sit down here, such a one, such a one;' and he turneth aside and sitteth down.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he taketh ten men of the elders of the city, and saith, `Sit down here;' and they sit down.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he saith to the redeemer, `A portion of the field which [is] to our brother, to Elimelech, hath Naomi sold, who hath come back from the fields of Moab;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and I said, I uncover thine ear, saying, Buy before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people; if thou dost redeem--redeem, and if none doth redeem--declare to me, and I know, for there is none save thee to redeem, and I after thee.' And he saith, I redeem [it].'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Boaz saith, `In the day of thy buying the field from the hand of Naomi, then from</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the redeemer saith, `I am not able to redeem [it] for myself, lest I destroy mine inheritance; redeem for thyself--thou--my right of redemption, for I am not able to redeem.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And this [is] formerly in Israel for redemption and for changing, to establish anything: a man hath drawn off his sandal, and given [it] to his neighbour, and this [is] the testimony in Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the redeemer saith to Boaz, `Buy [it] for thyself,' and draweth off his sandal.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Boaz saith to the elders, and [to] all the people, `Witnesses [are] ye to-day that I have bought all that [is] to Elimelech, and all that [is] to Chilion and Mahlon, from the hand of Naomi;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and also Ruth the Moabitess, wife of Mahlon, I have bought to myself for a wife, to raise up the name of the dead over his inheritance; and the name of the dead is not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place; witnesses ye [are] to-day.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And all the people who [are] in the gate say--also the elders--`Witnesses! Jehovah make the woman who is coming in unto thy house as Rachel and as Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel; and do thou virtuously in Ephrathah, and proclaim the Name in Beth-Lehem;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and let thy house be as the house of Pharez (whom Tamar bare to Judah), of the seed which Jehovah doth give to thee of this young woman.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Boaz taketh Ruth, and she becometh his wife, and he goeth in unto her, and Jehovah giveth to her conception, and she beareth a son.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the women say unto Naomi, `Blessed [is] Jehovah who hath not let a redeemer cease to thee to-day, and his name is proclaimed in Israel,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and he hath been to thee for a restorer of life, and for a nourisher of thine old age, for thy daughter-in-law who hath loved thee--who is better to thee than seven sons--hath borne him.'</p>

<p><a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Naomi taketh the lad, and layeth him in her bosom, and is to him for a nurse;</p>

<p><a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and the neighbouring women give to him a name, saying, `There hath been a son born to Naomi,' and they call his name Obed; he [is] father of Jesse, father of David.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And these are genealogies of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminidab,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and Amminidab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.</p>
