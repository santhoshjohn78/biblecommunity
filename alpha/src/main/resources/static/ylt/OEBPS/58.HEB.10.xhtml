<h2>Hebrews 10</h2>

<p><a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For the law having a shadow of the coming good things--not the very image of the matters, every year, by the same sacrifices that they offer continually, is never able to make perfect those coming near,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of those serving having no more conscience of sins, having once been purified?</p>

<p><a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> but in those [sacrifices] is a remembrance of sins every year,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Wherefore, coming into the world, he saith, `Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not will, and a body Thou didst prepare for me,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, Thou didst not delight,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> then I said, Lo, I come, (in a volume of the book it hath been written concerning me,) to do, O God, Thy will;'</p>

<p><a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> saying above--`Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt-offerings, and concerning sinoffering Thou didst not will, nor delight in,' --which according to the law are offered--</p>

<p><a id="c10_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> then he said, `Lo, I come to do, O God, Thy will;' he doth take away the first that the second he may establish;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and every priest, indeed, hath stood daily serving, and the same sacrifices many times offering, that are never able to take away sins.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered--to the end, did sit down on the right hand of God, --</p>

<p><a id="c10_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> as to the rest, expecting till He may place his enemies [as] his footstool,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> for by one offering he hath perfected to the end those sanctified;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and testify to us also doth the Holy Spirit, for after that He hath said before,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> `This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws on their hearts, and upon their minds I will write them,'</p>

<p><a id="c10_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and `their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no more;'</p>

<p><a id="c10_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and where forgiveness of these [is], there is no more offering for sin.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Having, therefore, brethren, boldness for the entrance into the holy places, in the blood of Jesus,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> which way he did initiate for us--new and living, through the vail, that is, his flesh- -</p>

<p><a id="c10_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and a high priest over the house of God,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> may we draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having the body bathed with pure water;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope, (for faithful [is] He who did promise),</p>

<p><a id="c10_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to good works,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as a custom of certain [is], but exhorting, and so much the more as ye see the day coming nigh.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For we--wilfully sinning after the receiving the full knowledge of the truth--no more for sins doth there remain a sacrifice,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery zeal, about to devour the opposers;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> any one who did set at nought a law of Moses, apart from mercies, by two or three witnesses, doth die,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy who the Son of God did trample on, and the blood of the covenant did count a common thing, in which he was sanctified, and to the Spirit of the grace did despite?</p>

<p><a id="c10_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> for we have known Him who is saying, `Vengeance [is] Mine, I will recompense, saith the Lord;' and again, `The Lord shall judge His people;' --</p>

<p><a id="c10_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> fearful [is] the falling into the hands of a living God.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And call to your remembrance the former days, in which, having been enlightened, ye did endure much conflict of sufferings,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made spectacles, and partly having become partners of those so living,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> for also with my bonds ye sympathised, and the robbery of your goods with joy ye did receive, knowing that ye have in yourselves a better substance in the heavens, and an enduring one.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> Ye may not cast away, then, your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> for of patience ye have need, that the will of God having done, ye may receive the promise,</p>

<p><a id="c10_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> for yet a very very little, He who is coming will come, and will not tarry;</p>

<p><a id="c10_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and `the righteous by faith shall live,' and `if he may draw back, My soul hath no pleasure in him,'</p>

<p><a id="c10_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> and we are not of those drawing back to destruction, but of those believing to a preserving of soul.</p>
