<h2>1 Thessalonians 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Wherefore no longer forbearing, we thought good to be left in Athens alone,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and did send Timotheus--our brother, and a ministrant of God, and our fellowworkman in the good news of the Christ--to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> that no one be moved in these tribulations, for yourselves have known that for this we are set,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> for even when we were with you, we said to you beforehand, that we are about to suffer tribulation, as also it did come to pass, and ye have known [it];</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> because of this also, I, no longer forbearing, did send to know your faith, lest he who is tempting did tempt you, and in vain might be our labour.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And now Timotheus having come unto us from you, and having declared good news to us of your faith and love, and that ye have a good remembrance of us always, desiring much to see us, as we also [to see] you,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> because of this we were comforted, brethren, over you, in all our tribulation and necessity, through your faith,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> because now we live, if ye may stand fast in the Lord;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for what thanks are we able to recompense to God for you, for all the joy with which we do joy because of you in the presence of our God?</p>

<p><a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> night and day exceedingly beseeching, that we might see your face, and perfect the things lacking in your faith.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and you the Lord cause to increase and to abound in the love to one another, and to all, even as we also to you,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> to the establishing your hearts blameless in sanctification before our God and Father, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.</p>
