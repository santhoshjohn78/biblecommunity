<h2>Isaiah 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In the year of the death of king Uzziah--I see the Lord, sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and His train is filling the temple.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Seraphs are standing above it: six wings hath each one; with two [each] covereth its face, and with two [each] covereth its feet, and with two [each] flieth.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And this one hath called unto that, and hath said: `Holy, Holy, Holy, [is] Jehovah of Hosts, The fulness of all the earth [is] His glory.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the posts of the thresholds are moved by the voice of him who is calling, and the house is full of smoke.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And I say, `Woe to me, for I have been silent, For a man--unclean of lips [am] I, And in midst of a people unclean of lips I am dwelling, Because the King, Jehovah of Hosts, have my eyes seen.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And flee unto me doth one of the seraphs, and in his hand a burning coal, (with tongs he hath taken [it] from off the altar,)</p>

<p><a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and he striketh against my mouth, and saith: `Lo, this hath stricken against thy lips, And turned aside is thine iniquity, And thy sin is covered.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I hear the voice of the Lord, saying: `Whom do I send? and who doth go for Us?' And I say, `Here [am] I, send me.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And He saith, `Go, and thou hast said to this people, Hear ye--to hear, and ye do not understand, And see ye--to see, and ye do not know.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Declare fat the heart of this people, And its ears declare heavy, And its eyes declare dazzled, Lest it see with its eyes, And with its ears hear, and its heart consider, And it hath turned back, and hath health.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And I say, `Till when, O Lord?' And He saith, `Surely till cities have been wasted without inhabitant, And houses without man, And the ground be wasted--a desolation,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Jehovah hath put man far off, And great [is] the forsaken part in the heart of the land.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And yet in it a tenth, and it hath turned, And hath been for a burning, As a teil-tree, and as an oak, that in falling, Have substance in them, The holy seed [is] its substance!'</p>
