<h2>Psalms 64</h2>

<p><a id="c64_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To the Overseer. --A Psalm of David. Hear, O God, my voice, in my meditation, From the fear of an enemy Thou keepest my life,</p>

<p><a id="c64_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Hidest me from the secret counsel of evil doers, From the tumult of workers of iniquity.</p>

<p><a id="c64_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Who sharpened as a sword their tongue, They directed their arrow--a bitter word.</p>

<p><a id="c64_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> To shoot in secret places the perfect, Suddenly they shoot him, and fear not.</p>

<p><a id="c64_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They strengthen for themselves an evil thing, They recount of the hiding of snares, They have said, `Who doth look at it?'</p>

<p><a id="c64_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> They search out perverse things, `We perfected a searching search,' And the inward part of man, and the heart [are] deep.</p>

<p><a id="c64_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And God doth shoot them [with] an arrow, Sudden have been their wounds,</p>

<p><a id="c64_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And they cause him to stumble, Against them [is] their own tongue, Every looker on them fleeth away.</p>

<p><a id="c64_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And all men fear, and declare the work of God, And His deed they have considered wisely.</p>

<p><a id="c64_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The righteous doth rejoice in Jehovah, And hath trusted in Him, And boast themselves do all the upright of heart!</p>
