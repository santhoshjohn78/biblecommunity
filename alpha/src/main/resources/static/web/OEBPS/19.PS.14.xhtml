<h2>Psalms 14</h2>

<p><a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”</p>

<p>They are corrupt.</p>

<p>They have done abominable deeds.</p>

<p>There is no one who does good.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men,</p>

<p>to see if there were any who understood,</p>

<p>who sought after God.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> They have all gone aside.</p>

<p>They have together become corrupt.</p>

<p>There is no one who does good, no, not one.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge,</p>

<p>who eat up my people as they eat bread,</p>

<p>and don’t call on Yahweh?</p>

<p><a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> There they were in great fear,</p>

<p>for God is in the generation of the righteous.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> You frustrate the plan of the poor,</p>

<p>because Yahweh is his refuge.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!</p>

<p>When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people,</p>

<p>then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p>
