<h2>2 Corinthians 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow. <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me? <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn’t have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> This punishment which was inflicted by the many is sufficient for such a one; <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ, <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord, <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn’t find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish; <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.</p>
