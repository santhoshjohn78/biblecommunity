<h2>Job 25</h2>

<p><a id="c25_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,</p>

<p><a id="c25_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> “Dominion and fear are with him.</p>

<p>He makes peace in his high places.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Can his armies be counted?</p>

<p>On whom does his light not arise?</p>

<p><a id="c25_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> How then can man be just with God?</p>

<p>Or how can he who is born of a woman be clean?</p>

<p><a id="c25_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Behold, even the moon has no brightness,</p>

<p>and the stars are not pure in his sight;</p>

<p><a id="c25_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> How much less man, who is a worm,</p>

<p>the son of man, who is a worm!”</p>
