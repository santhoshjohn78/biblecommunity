<h2>2 Chronicles 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel. <a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. <a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and didn’t seek the Baals, <a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not in the ways of Israel. <a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Therefore Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand. All Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance. <a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> His heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh. Furthermore, he took away the high places and the Asherah poles out of Judah. <a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; <a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. <a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> They taught in Judah, having the book of Yahweh’s law with them. They went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people. <a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat. <a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute. The Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams, and seven thousand seven hundred male goats. <a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah. <a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem. <a id="c17_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> This was the numbering of them according to their fathers’ houses: From Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor; <a id="c17_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand; <a id="c17_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to Yahweh, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor. <a id="c17_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> From Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield; <a id="c17_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and next to him Jehozabad, and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready and prepared for war. <a id="c17_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> These were those who waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.</p>
