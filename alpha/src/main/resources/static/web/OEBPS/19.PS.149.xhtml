<h2>Psalms 149</h2>

<p><a id="c149_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise Yahweh!</p>

<p>Sing to Yahweh a new song,</p>

<p>his praise in the assembly of the saints.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let Israel rejoice in him who made them.</p>

<p>Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Let them praise his name in the dance!</p>

<p>Let them sing praises to him with tambourine and harp!</p>

<p><a id="c149_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people.</p>

<p>He crowns the humble with salvation.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Let the saints rejoice in honor.</p>

<p>Let them sing for joy on their beds.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> May the high praises of God be in their mouths,</p>

<p>and a two-edged sword in their hand;</p>

<p><a id="c149_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> To execute vengeance on the nations,</p>

<p>and punishments on the peoples;</p>

<p><a id="c149_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> To bind their kings with chains,</p>

<p>and their nobles with fetters of iron;</p>

<p><a id="c149_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> to execute on them the written judgment.</p>

<p>All his saints have this honor.</p>

<p>Praise Yah!</p>
