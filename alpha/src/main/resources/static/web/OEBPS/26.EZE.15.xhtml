<h2>Ezekiel 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> “Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest? <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Will wood be taken of it to make anything? Will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel on it? <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both its ends, and the middle of it is burned. Is it profitable for any work? <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Behold, when it was whole, it was suitable for no work. How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned, will it yet be suitable for any work?”</p>

<p><a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I will set my face against them. They will go out from the fire, but the fire will devour them; and you will know that I am Yahweh, when I set my face against them. <a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass,” says the Lord Yahweh.</p>
