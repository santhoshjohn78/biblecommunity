<h2>Psalms 123</h2>

<p><a id="c123_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To you I do lift up my eyes,</p>

<p>you who sit in the heavens.</p>

<p><a id="c123_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,</p>

<p>as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress;</p>

<p>so our eyes look to Yahweh, our God,</p>

<p>until he has mercy on us.</p>

<p><a id="c123_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us,</p>

<p>for we have endured much contempt.</p>

<p><a id="c123_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease,</p>

<p>with the contempt of the proud.</p>
