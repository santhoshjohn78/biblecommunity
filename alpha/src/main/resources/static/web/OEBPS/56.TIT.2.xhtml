<h2>Titus 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> But say the things which fit sound doctrine, <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance: <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good; <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded; <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting; <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world; <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ; <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.</p>
