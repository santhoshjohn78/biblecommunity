<h2>Psalms 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary?</p>

<p>Who shall live on your holy hill?</p>

<p><a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> He who walks blamelessly does what is right,</p>

<p>and speaks truth in his heart;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He who doesn’t slander with his tongue,</p>

<p>nor does evil to his friend,</p>

<p>nor casts slurs against his fellow man;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> In whose eyes a vile man is despised,</p>

<p>but who honors those who fear Yahweh;</p>

<p>he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn’t change;</p>

<p><a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> he who doesn’t lend out his money for usury,</p>

<p>nor take a bribe against the innocent.</p>

<p>He who does these things shall never be shaken.</p>
