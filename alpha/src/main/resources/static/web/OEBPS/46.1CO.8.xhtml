<h2>1 Corinthians 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn’t yet know as he ought to know. <a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him. <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one. <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For though there are things that are called “gods”, whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many “gods” and many “lords”; <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him. <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> However, that knowledge isn’t in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don’t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better. <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak. <a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol’s temple, won’t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? <a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died. <a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. <a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Therefore if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forever more, that I don’t cause my brother to stumble.</p>
