<h2>Malachi 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> “For, behold, the day comes, it burns as a furnace; and all the proud, and all who work wickedness, will be stubble; and the day that comes will burn them up,” says Yahweh of Armies, “that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> But to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings. You will go out, and leap like calves of the stall. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> You shall tread down the wicked; for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make,” says Yahweh of Armies.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> “Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.”</p>
