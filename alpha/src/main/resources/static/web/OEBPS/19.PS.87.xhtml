<h2>Psalms 87</h2>

<p><a id="c87_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> His foundation is in the holy mountains.</p>

<p><a id="c87_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</p>

<p><a id="c87_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c87_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I will record Rahab<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> and Babylon among those who acknowledge me.</p>

<p>Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia:</p>

<p>“This one was born there.”</p>

<p><a id="c87_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Yes, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one was born in her”;</p>

<p>the Most High himself will establish her.</p>

<p><a id="c87_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Yahweh will count, when he writes up the peoples,</p>

<p>“This one was born there.” Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c87_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Those who sing as well as those who dance say,</p>

<p>“All my springs are in you.”</p>
