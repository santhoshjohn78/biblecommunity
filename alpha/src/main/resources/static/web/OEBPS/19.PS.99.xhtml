<h2>Psalms 99</h2>

<p><a id="c99_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh reigns! Let the peoples tremble.</p>

<p>He sits enthroned among the cherubim.</p>

<p>Let the earth be moved.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Yahweh is great in Zion.</p>

<p>He is high above all the peoples.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Let them praise your great and awesome name.</p>

<p>He is Holy!</p>

<p><a id="c99_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The Kingâ€™s strength also loves justice.</p>

<p>You do establish equity.</p>

<p>You execute justice and righteousness in Jacob.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Exalt Yahweh our God.</p>

<p>Worship at his footstool.</p>

<p>He is Holy!</p>

<p><a id="c99_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Moses and Aaron were among his priests,</p>

<p>Samuel among those who call on his name;</p>

<p>they called on Yahweh, and he answered them.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud.</p>

<p>They kept his testimonies,</p>

<p>the statute that he gave them.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> You answered them, Yahweh our God.</p>

<p>You are a God who forgave them,</p>

<p>although you took vengeance for their doings.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Exalt Yahweh, our God.</p>

<p>Worship at his holy hill,</p>

<p>for Yahweh, our God, is holy!</p>
