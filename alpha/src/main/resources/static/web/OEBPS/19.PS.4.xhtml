<h2>Psalms 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness.</p>

<p>Give me relief from my distress.</p>

<p>Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?</p>

<p>Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly:</p>

<p>Yahweh will hear when I call to him.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Stand in awe, and don’t sin.</p>

<p>Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness.</p>

<p>Put your trust in Yahweh.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Many say, “Who will show us any good?”</p>

<p>Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> You have put gladness in my heart,</p>

<p>more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep,</p>

<p>for you, Yahweh alone, make me live in safety.</p>
