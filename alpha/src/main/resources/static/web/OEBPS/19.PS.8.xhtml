<h2>Psalms 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth,</p>

<p>who has set your glory above the heavens!</p>

<p><a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength,</p>

<p>because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,</p>

<p>the moon and the stars, which you have ordained;</p>

<p><a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> what is man, that you think of him?</p>

<p>What is the son of man, that you care for him?</p>

<p><a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For you have made him a little lower than God,<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a></p>

<p>and crowned him with glory and honor.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> You make him ruler over the works of your hands.</p>

<p>You have put all things under his feet:</p>

<p><a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> All sheep and cattle,</p>

<p>yes, and the animals of the field,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The birds of the sky, the fish of the sea,</p>

<p>and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Yahweh, our Lord,</p>

<p>how majestic is your name in all the earth!</p>
