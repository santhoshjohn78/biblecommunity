<h2>2 Timothy 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good, <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For some of these are people who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith, are rejected. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Every Scripture is God-breathed and<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.</p>
