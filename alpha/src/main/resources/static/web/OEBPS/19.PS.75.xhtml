<h2>Psalms 75</h2>

<p><a id="c75_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> We give thanks to you, God.</p>

<p>We give thanks, for your Name is near.</p>

<p>Men tell about your wondrous works.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> When I choose the appointed time,</p>

<p>I will judge blamelessly.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The earth and all its inhabitants quake.</p>

<p>I firmly hold its pillars. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!”</p>

<p>I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Don’t lift up your horn on high.</p>

<p>Don’t speak with a stiff neck.”</p>

<p><a id="c75_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For neither from the east, nor from the west,</p>

<p>nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But God is the judge.</p>

<p>He puts down one, and lifts up another.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For in Yahweh’s hand there is a cup,</p>

<p>full of foaming wine mixed with spices.</p>

<p>He pours it out.</p>

<p>Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But I will declare this forever:</p>

<p>I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,</p>

<p>but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.</p>
