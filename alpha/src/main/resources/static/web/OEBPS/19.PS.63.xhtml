<h2>Psalms 63</h2>

<p><a id="c63_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> God, you are my God.</p>

<p>I will earnestly seek you.</p>

<p>My soul thirsts for you.</p>

<p>My flesh longs for you,</p>

<p>in a dry and weary land, where there is no water.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> So I have seen you in the sanctuary,</p>

<p>watching your power and your glory.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Because your loving kindness is better than life,</p>

<p>my lips shall praise you.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> So I will bless you while I live.</p>

<p>I will lift up my hands in your name.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food.</p>

<p>My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips,</p>

<p><a id="c63_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> when I remember you on my bed,</p>

<p>and think about you in the night watches.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For you have been my help.</p>

<p>I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> My soul stays close to you.</p>

<p>Your right hand holds me up.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But those who seek my soul, to destroy it,</p>

<p>shall go into the lower parts of the earth.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> They shall be given over to the power of the sword.</p>

<p>They shall be jackal food.</p>

<p><a id="c63_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But the king shall rejoice in God.</p>

<p>Everyone who swears by him will praise him,</p>

<p>for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced.</p>
