<h2>Isaiah 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In that day you will say, “I will give thanks to you, Yahweh; for though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you comfort me. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Behold, God is my salvation. I will trust, and will not be afraid; for Yah, Yahweh, is my strength and song; and he has become my salvation.” <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation. <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> In that day you will say, “Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name. Declare his doings among the peoples. Proclaim that his name is exalted! <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Sing to Yahweh, for he has done excellent things! Let this be known in all the earth! <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for the Holy One of Israel is great among you!”</p>
