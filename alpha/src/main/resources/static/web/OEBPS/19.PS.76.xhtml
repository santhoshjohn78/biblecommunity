<h2>Psalms 76</h2>

<p><a id="c76_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In Judah, God is known.</p>

<p>His name is great in Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> His tabernacle is also in Salem;</p>

<p>His dwelling place in Zion.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow,</p>

<p>the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Glorious are you, and excellent,</p>

<p>more than mountains of game.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Valiant men lie plundered,</p>

<p>they have slept their last sleep.</p>

<p>None of the men of war can lift their hands.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> At your rebuke, God of Jacob,</p>

<p>both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> You, even you, are to be feared.</p>

<p>Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?</p>

<p><a id="c76_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> You pronounced judgment from heaven.</p>

<p>The earth feared, and was silent,</p>

<p><a id="c76_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> when God arose to judgment,</p>

<p>to save all the afflicted ones of the earth. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Surely the wrath of man praises you.</p>

<p>The survivors of your wrath are restrained.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Make vows to Yahweh your God, and fulfill them!</p>

<p>Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared.</p>

<p><a id="c76_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> He will cut off the spirit of princes.</p>

<p>He is feared by the kings of the earth.</p>
