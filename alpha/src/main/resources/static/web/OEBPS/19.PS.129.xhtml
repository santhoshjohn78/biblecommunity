<h2>Psalms 129</h2>

<p><a id="c129_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up.</p>

<p>Let Israel now say,</p>

<p><a id="c129_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> many times they have afflicted me from my youth up,</p>

<p>yet they have not prevailed against me.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The plowers plowed on my back.</p>

<p>They made their furrows long.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Yahweh is righteous.</p>

<p>He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Let them be disappointed and turned backward,</p>

<p>all those who hate Zion.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let them be as the grass on the housetops,</p>

<p>which withers before it grows up;</p>

<p><a id="c129_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand,</p>

<p>nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Neither do those who go by say,</p>

<p>“The blessing of Yahweh be on you.</p>

<p>We bless you in Yahweh’s name.”</p>
