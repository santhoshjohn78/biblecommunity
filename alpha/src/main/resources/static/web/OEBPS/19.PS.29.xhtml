<h2>Psalms 29</h2>

<p><a id="c29_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Ascribe to Yahweh, you sons of the mighty,</p>

<p>ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name.</p>

<p>Worship Yahweh in holy array.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Yahweh’s voice is on the waters.</p>

<p>The God of glory thunders, even Yahweh on many waters.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Yahweh’s voice is powerful.</p>

<p>Yahweh’s voice is full of majesty.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Yahweh’s voice breaks the cedars.</p>

<p>Yes, Yahweh breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He makes them also to skip like a calf;</p>

<p>Lebanon and Sirion like a young, wild ox.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Yahweh’s voice strikes with flashes of lightning.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Yahweh’s voice shakes the wilderness.</p>

<p>Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Yahweh’s voice makes the deer calve,</p>

<p>and strips the forests bare.</p>

<p>In his temple everything says, “Glory!”</p>

<p><a id="c29_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Yahweh sat enthroned at the Flood.</p>

<p>Yes, Yahweh sits as King forever.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Yahweh will give strength to his people.</p>

<p>Yahweh will bless his people with peace.</p>
