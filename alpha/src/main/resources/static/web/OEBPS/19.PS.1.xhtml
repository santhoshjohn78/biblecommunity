<h2>Psalms 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked,</p>

<p>nor stand on the path of sinners,</p>

<p>nor sit in the seat of scoffers;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> but his delight is in Yahweh’s<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> law.</p>

<p>On his law he meditates day and night.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,</p>

<p>that produces its fruit in its season,</p>

<p>whose leaf also does not wither.</p>

<p>Whatever he does shall prosper.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The wicked are not so,</p>

<p>but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,</p>

<p>nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,</p>

<p>but the way of the wicked shall perish.</p>
