<h2>Ephesians 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles, <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you; <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words, <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ; <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News, <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> of which I was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and to make all men see what is the administration<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ; <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places, <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord; <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man; <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love, <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and height and depth, <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and to know Christ’s love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.</p>
