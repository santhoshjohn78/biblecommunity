<h2>Numbers 7</h2>

<p><a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> On the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, with all its furniture, and the altar with all its vessels, and had anointed and sanctified them; <a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers’ houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes. These are they who were over those who were counted: <a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and they brought their offering before Yahweh, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the tabernacle. <a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> “Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the Tent of Meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.”</p>

<p><a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites. <a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to their service: <a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. <a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them; they carried it on their shoulders.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The princes gave offerings for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes gave their offerings before the altar.</p>
