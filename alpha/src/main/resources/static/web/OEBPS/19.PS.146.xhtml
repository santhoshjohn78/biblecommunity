<h2>Psalms 146</h2>

<p><a id="c146_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise Yah!</p>

<p>Praise Yahweh, my soul.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> While I live, I will praise Yahweh.</p>

<p>I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Donâ€™t put your trust in princes,</p>

<p>each a son of man in whom there is no help.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth.</p>

<p>In that very day, his thoughts perish.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help,</p>

<p>whose hope is in Yahweh, his God:</p>

<p><a id="c146_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> who made heaven and earth,</p>

<p>the sea, and all that is in them;</p>

<p>who keeps truth forever;</p>

<p><a id="c146_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> who executes justice for the oppressed;</p>

<p>who gives food to the hungry.</p>

<p>Yahweh frees the prisoners.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind.</p>

<p>Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down.</p>

<p>Yahweh loves the righteous.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Yahweh preserves the foreigners.</p>

<p>He upholds the fatherless and widow,</p>

<p>but the way of the wicked he turns upside down.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Yahweh will reign forever;</p>

<p>your God, O Zion, to all generations.</p>

<p>Praise Yah!</p>
