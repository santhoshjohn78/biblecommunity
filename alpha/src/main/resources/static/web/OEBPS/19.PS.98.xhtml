<h2>Psalms 98</h2>

<p><a id="c98_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Sing to Yahweh a new song,</p>

<p>for he has done marvelous things!</p>

<p>His right hand, and his holy arm, have worked salvation for him.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Yahweh has made known his salvation.</p>

<p>He has openly shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel.</p>

<p>All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all the earth!</p>

<p>Burst out and sing for joy, yes, sing praises!</p>

<p><a id="c98_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp,</p>

<p>with the harp and the voice of melody.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> With trumpets and sound of the ramâ€™s horn,</p>

<p>make a joyful noise before the King, Yahweh.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Let the sea roar with its fullness;</p>

<p>the world, and those who dwell therein.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Let the rivers clap their hands.</p>

<p>Let the mountains sing for joy together.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Let them sing before Yahweh,</p>

<p>for he comes to judge the earth.</p>

<p>He will judge the world with righteousness,</p>

<p>and the peoples with equity.</p>
