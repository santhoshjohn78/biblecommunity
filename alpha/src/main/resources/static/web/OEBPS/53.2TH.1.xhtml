<h2>2 Thessalonians 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ: <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> We are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers,<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> even as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds; <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that you may be counted worthy of God’s Kingdom, for which you also suffer. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Since it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who afflict you, <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> giving vengeance to those who don’t know God, and to those who don’t obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus, <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> who will pay the penalty: eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might, <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> when he comes to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired among all those who have believed (because our testimony to you was believed) in that day.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> To this end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith, with power; <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> that the name of our Lord Jesus<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
