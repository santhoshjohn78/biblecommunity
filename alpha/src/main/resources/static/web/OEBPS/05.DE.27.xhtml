<h2>Deuteronomy 27</h2>

You shall not use any iron tool on them. <a id="c27_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> You shall build Yahweh your God’s altar of uncut stones. You shall offer burnt offerings on it to Yahweh your God. <a id="c27_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> You shall sacrifice peace offerings, and shall eat there. You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God. <a id="c27_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> You shall write on the stones all the words of this law very plainly.”</p>
