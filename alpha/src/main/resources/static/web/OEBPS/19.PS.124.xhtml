<h2>Psalms 124</h2>

<p><a id="c124_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,</p>

<p>let Israel now say,</p>

<p><a id="c124_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,</p>

<p>when men rose up against us;</p>

<p><a id="c124_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> then they would have swallowed us up alive,</p>

<p>when their wrath was kindled against us;</p>

<p><a id="c124_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> then the waters would have overwhelmed us,</p>

<p>the stream would have gone over our soul;</p>

<p><a id="c124_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.</p>

<p><a id="c124_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Blessed be Yahweh,</p>

<p>who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.</p>

<p><a id="c124_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s snare.</p>

<p>The snare is broken, and we have escaped.</p>

<p><a id="c124_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Our help is in Yahweh’s name,</p>

<p>who made heaven and earth.</p>
