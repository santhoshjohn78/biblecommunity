<h2>Psalms 95</h2>

<p><a id="c95_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Oh come, let’s sing to Yahweh.</p>

<p>Let’s shout aloud to the rock of our salvation!</p>

<p><a id="c95_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let’s come before his presence with thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Let’s extol him with songs!</p>

<p><a id="c95_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For Yahweh is a great God,</p>

<p>a great King above all gods.</p>

<p><a id="c95_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> In his hand are the deep places of the earth.</p>

<p>The heights of the mountains are also his.</p>

<p><a id="c95_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The sea is his, and he made it.</p>

<p>His hands formed the dry land.</p>

<p><a id="c95_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Oh come, let’s worship and bow down.</p>

<p>Let’s kneel before Yahweh, our Maker,</p>

<p><a id="c95_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> for he is our God.</p>

<p>We are the people of his pasture,</p>

<p>and the sheep in his care.</p>

<p>Today, oh that you would hear his voice!</p>

<p><a id="c95_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Don’t harden your heart, as at Meribah,</p>

<p>as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,</p>

<p><a id="c95_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> when your fathers tempted me,</p>

<p>tested me, and saw my work.</p>

<p><a id="c95_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Forty long years I was grieved with that generation,</p>

<p>and said, “It is a people that errs in their heart.</p>

<p>They have not known my ways.”</p>

<p><a id="c95_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Therefore I swore in my wrath,</p>

<p>“They won’t enter into my rest.”</p>
