<h2>Psalms 100</h2>

<p><a id="c100_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Shout for joy to Yahweh, all you lands!</p>

<p><a id="c100_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Serve Yahweh with gladness.</p>

<p>Come before his presence with singing.</p>

<p><a id="c100_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Know that Yahweh, he is God.</p>

<p>It is he who has made us, and we are his.</p>

<p>We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.</p>

<p><a id="c100_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving,</p>

<p>into his courts with praise.</p>

<p>Give thanks to him, and bless his name.</p>

<p><a id="c100_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For Yahweh is good.</p>

<p>His loving kindness endures forever,</p>

<p>his faithfulness to all generations.</p>
