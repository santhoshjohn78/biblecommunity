<h2>Psalms 52</h2>

<p><a id="c52_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man?</p>

<p>God’s loving kindness endures continually.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Your tongue plots destruction,</p>

<p>like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> You love evil more than good,</p>

<p>lying rather than speaking the truth. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> You love all devouring words,</p>

<p>you deceitful tongue.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> God will likewise destroy you forever.</p>

<p>He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent,</p>

<p>and root you out of the land of the living. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The righteous also will see it, and fear,</p>

<p>and laugh at him, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c52_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> “Behold, this is the man who didn’t make God his strength,</p>

<p>but trusted in the abundance of his riches,</p>

<p>and strengthened himself in his wickedness.”</p>

<p><a id="c52_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s house.</p>

<p>I trust in God’s loving kindness forever and ever.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it.</p>

<p>I will hope in your name, for it is good,</p>

<p>in the presence of your saints.</p>
