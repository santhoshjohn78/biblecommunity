<h2>Psalms 46</h2>

<p><a id="c46_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> God is our refuge and strength,</p>

<p>a very present help in trouble.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Therefore we won’t be afraid, though the earth changes,</p>

<p>though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas;</p>

<p><a id="c46_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> though its waters roar and are troubled,</p>

<p>though the mountains tremble with their swelling. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad,</p>

<p>the holy place of the tents of the Most High.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> God is within her. She shall not be moved.</p>

<p>God will help her at dawn.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The nations raged. The kingdoms were moved.</p>

<p>He lifted his voice, and the earth melted.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Yahweh of Armies is with us.</p>

<p>The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Come, see Yahweh’s works,</p>

<p>what desolations he has made in the earth.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He makes wars cease to the end of the earth.</p>

<p>He breaks the bow, and shatters the spear.</p>

<p>He burns the chariots in the fire.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> “Be still, and know that I am God.</p>

<p>I will be exalted among the nations.</p>

<p>I will be exalted in the earth.”</p>

<p><a id="c46_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Yahweh of Armies is with us.</p>

<p>The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.</p>
