<h2>Jeremiah 47</h2>

<p><a id="c47_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh’s word that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before that Pharaoh struck Gaza.</p>

<p><a id="c47_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Yahweh says:</p>

<p>“Behold, waters rise up out of the north,</p>

<p>and will become an overflowing stream,</p>

<p>and will overflow the land and all that is therein,</p>

<p>the city and those who dwell therein.</p>

<p>The men will cry,</p>

<p>and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail.</p>

<p><a id="c47_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones,</p>

<p>at the rushing of his chariots,</p>

<p>at the rumbling of his wheels,</p>

<p>the fathers don’t look back to their children</p>

<p>for feebleness of hands;</p>

<p><a id="c47_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines,</p>

<p>to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains;</p>

<p>for Yahweh will destroy the Philistines,</p>

<p>the remnant of the isle of Caphtor.</p>

<p><a id="c47_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Baldness has come on Gaza;</p>

<p>Ashkelon is brought to nothing,</p>

<p>the remnant of their valley:</p>

<p>how long will you cut yourself?</p>

<p><a id="c47_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> “‘You sword of Yahweh, how long will it be before you are quiet?</p>

<p>Put yourself back into your scabbard;</p>

<p>rest, and be still.’</p>

<p><a id="c47_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> “How can you be quiet,</p>

<p>since Yahweh has given you a command?</p>

<p>Against Ashkelon, and against the seashore,</p>

<p>there has he appointed it.”</p>
