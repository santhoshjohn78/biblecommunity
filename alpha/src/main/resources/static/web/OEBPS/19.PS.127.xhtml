<h2>Psalms 127</h2>

<p><a id="c127_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unless Yahweh builds the house,</p>

<p>they labor in vain who build it.</p>

<p>Unless Yahweh watches over the city,</p>

<p>the watchman guards it in vain.</p>

<p><a id="c127_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> It is vain for you to rise up early,</p>

<p>to stay up late,</p>

<p>eating the bread of toil;</p>

<p>for he gives sleep to his loved ones.</p>

<p><a id="c127_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh.</p>

<p>The fruit of the womb is his reward.</p>

<p><a id="c127_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,</p>

<p>so are the children of youth.</p>

<p><a id="c127_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them.</p>

<p>They wonâ€™t be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.</p>
