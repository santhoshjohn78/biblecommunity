<h2>Psalms 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In Yahweh, I take refuge.</p>

<p>How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain!”</p>

<p><a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For, behold, the wicked bend their bows.</p>

<p>They set their arrows on the strings,</p>

<p>that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If the foundations are destroyed,</p>

<p>what can the righteous do?</p>

<p><a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Yahweh is in his holy temple.</p>

<p>Yahweh is on his throne in heaven.</p>

<p>His eyes observe.</p>

<p>His eyes examine the children of men.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Yahweh examines the righteous,</p>

<p>but the wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> On the wicked he will rain blazing coals;</p>

<p>fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For Yahweh is righteous.</p>

<p>He loves righteousness.</p>

<p>The upright shall see his face.</p>
