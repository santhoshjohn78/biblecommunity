<h2>Ephesians 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus: <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ; <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without defect before him in love; <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire, <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely gave us favor in the Beloved, <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in him; <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> in whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who does all things after the counsel of his will; <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ: <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the Good News of your salvation—in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of his glory. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which you have toward all the saints, <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> don’t cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> having the eyes of your hearts<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, <a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might <a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places, <a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come. <a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly, <a id="c1_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.</p>
