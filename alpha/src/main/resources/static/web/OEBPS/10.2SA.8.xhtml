Joram brought with him vessels of silver, vessels of gold, and vessels of brass: <a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> King David also dedicated these to Yahweh, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued; <a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> of Syria, of Moab, of the children of Ammon, of the Philistines, of Amalek, and of the plunder of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.</p>
