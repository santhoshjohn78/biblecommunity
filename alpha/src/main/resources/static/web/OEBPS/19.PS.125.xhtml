<h2>Psalms 125</h2>

<p><a id="c125_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion,</p>

<p>which can’t be moved, but remains forever.</p>

<p><a id="c125_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> As the mountains surround Jerusalem,</p>

<p>so Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forward and forever more.</p>

<p><a id="c125_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For the scepter of wickedness won’t remain over the allotment of the righteous;</p>

<p>so that the righteous won’t use their hands to do evil.</p>

<p><a id="c125_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good,</p>

<p>to those who are upright in their hearts.</p>

<p><a id="c125_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways,</p>

<p>Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity.</p>

<p>Peace be on Israel.</p>
