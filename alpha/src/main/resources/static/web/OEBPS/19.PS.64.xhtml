<h2>Psalms 64</h2>

<p><a id="c64_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Hear my voice, God, in my complaint.</p>

<p>Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</p>

<p><a id="c64_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked,</p>

<p>from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil;</p>

<p><a id="c64_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> who sharpen their tongue like a sword,</p>

<p>and aim their arrows, deadly words,</p>

<p><a id="c64_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> to shoot innocent men from ambushes.</p>

<p>They shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly.</p>

<p><a id="c64_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They encourage themselves in evil plans.</p>

<p>They talk about laying snares secretly.</p>

<p>They say, “Who will see them?”</p>

<p><a id="c64_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> They plot injustice, saying, “We have made a perfect plan!”</p>

<p>Surely man’s mind and heart are cunning.</p>

<p><a id="c64_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But God will shoot at them.</p>

<p>They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow.</p>

<p><a id="c64_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Their own tongues shall ruin them.</p>

<p>All who see them will shake their heads.</p>

<p><a id="c64_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> All mankind shall be afraid.</p>

<p>They shall declare the work of God,</p>

<p>and shall wisely ponder what he has done.</p>

<p><a id="c64_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The righteous shall be glad in Yahweh,</p>

<p>and shall take refuge in him.</p>

<p>All the upright in heart shall praise him!</p>
