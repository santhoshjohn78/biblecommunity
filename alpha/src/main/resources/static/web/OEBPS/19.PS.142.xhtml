<h2>Psalms 142</h2>

<p><a id="c142_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I cry with my voice to Yahweh.</p>

<p>With my voice, I ask Yahweh for mercy.</p>

<p><a id="c142_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I pour out my complaint before him.</p>

<p>I tell him my troubles.</p>

<p><a id="c142_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,</p>

<p>you knew my route.</p>

<p>On the path in which I walk,</p>

<p>they have hidden a snare for me.</p>

<p><a id="c142_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Look on my right, and see;</p>

<p>for there is no one who is concerned for me.</p>

<p>Refuge has fled from me.</p>

<p>No one cares for my soul.</p>

<p><a id="c142_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I cried to you, Yahweh.</p>

<p>I said, “You are my refuge,</p>

<p>my portion in the land of the living.”</p>

<p><a id="c142_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Listen to my cry,</p>

<p>for I am in desperate need.</p>

<p>deliver me from my persecutors,</p>

<p>For they are stronger than me.</p>

<p><a id="c142_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Bring my soul out of prison,</p>

<p>that I may give thanks to your name.</p>

<p>The righteous will surround me,</p>

<p>for you will be good to me.</p>
