<h2>Leviticus 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘If a woman conceives, and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of her monthly period she shall be unclean. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> She shall continue in the blood of purification thirty-three days. She shall not touch any holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her period; and she shall continue in the blood of purification sixty-six days.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> “‘When the days of her purification are completed, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the door of the Tent of Meeting, a year old lamb for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering: <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and he shall offer it before Yahweh, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood.</p>

<p>“‘This is the law for her who bears, whether a male or a female. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> If she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves, or two young pigeons; the one for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.’”</p>
