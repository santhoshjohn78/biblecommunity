<h2>Psalms 24</h2>

<p><a id="c24_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The earth is Yahweh’s, with its fullness;</p>

<p>the world, and those who dwell therein.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For he has founded it on the seas,</p>

<p>and established it on the floods.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Who may ascend to Yahweh’s hill?</p>

<p>Who may stand in his holy place?</p>

<p><a id="c24_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He who has clean hands and a pure heart;</p>

<p>who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood,</p>

<p>and has not sworn deceitfully.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He shall receive a blessing from Yahweh,</p>

<p>righteousness from the God of his salvation.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> This is the generation of those who seek Him,</p>

<p>who seek your face—even Jacob. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Lift up your heads, you gates!</p>

<p>Be lifted up, you everlasting doors,</p>

<p>and the King of glory will come in.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Who is the King of glory?</p>

<p>Yahweh strong and mighty,</p>

<p>Yahweh mighty in battle.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Lift up your heads, you gates;</p>

<p>yes, lift them up, you everlasting doors,</p>

<p>and the King of glory will come in.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Who is this King of glory?</p>

<p>Yahweh of Armies is the King of glory! Selah.</p>
