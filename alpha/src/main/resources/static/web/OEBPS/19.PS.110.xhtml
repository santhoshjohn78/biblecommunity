<h2>Psalms 110</h2>

<p><a id="c110_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh says to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand,</p>

<p>until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet.”</p>

<p><a id="c110_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Yahweh will send out the rod of your strength out of Zion.</p>

<p>Rule among your enemies.</p>

<p><a id="c110_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power, in holy array.</p>

<p>Out of the womb of the morning, you have the dew of your youth.</p>

<p><a id="c110_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Yahweh has sworn, and will not change his mind:</p>

<p>“You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”</p>

<p><a id="c110_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The Lord is at your right hand.</p>

<p>He will crush kings in the day of his wrath.</p>

<p><a id="c110_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He will judge among the nations.</p>

<p>He will heap up dead bodies.</p>

<p>He will crush the ruler of the whole earth.</p>

<p><a id="c110_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He will drink of the brook on the way;</p>

<p>therefore he will lift up his head.</p>
