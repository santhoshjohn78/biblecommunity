<h2>Psalms 122</h2>

<p><a id="c122_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I was glad when they said to me,</p>

<p>“Let’s go to Yahweh’s house!”</p>

<p><a id="c122_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem;</p>

<p><a id="c122_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together;</p>

<p><a id="c122_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> where the tribes go up, even Yah’s tribes,</p>

<p>according to an ordinance for Israel,</p>

<p>to give thanks to Yahweh’s name.</p>

<p><a id="c122_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For there are set thrones for judgment,</p>

<p>the thrones of David’s house.</p>

<p><a id="c122_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Those who love you will prosper.</p>

<p><a id="c122_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Peace be within your walls,</p>

<p>and prosperity within your palaces.</p>

<p><a id="c122_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For my brothers’ and companions’ sakes,</p>

<p>I will now say, “Peace be within you.”</p>

<p><a id="c122_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God,</p>

<p>I will seek your good.</p>
