<h2>Psalms 114</h2>

<p><a id="c114_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> When Israel went out of Egypt,</p>

<p>the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language;</p>

<p><a id="c114_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Judah became his sanctuary,</p>

<p>Israel his dominion.</p>

<p><a id="c114_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The sea saw it, and fled.</p>

<p>The Jordan was driven back.</p>

<p><a id="c114_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The mountains skipped like rams,</p>

<p>the little hills like lambs.</p>

<p><a id="c114_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> What was it, you sea, that you fled?</p>

<p>You Jordan, that you turned back?</p>

<p><a id="c114_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> You mountains, that you skipped like rams;</p>

<p>you little hills, like lambs?</p>

<p><a id="c114_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord,</p>

<p>at the presence of the God of Jacob,</p>

<p><a id="c114_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> who turned the rock into a pool of water,</p>

<p>the flint into a spring of waters.</p>
