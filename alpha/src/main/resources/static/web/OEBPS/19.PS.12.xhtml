<h2>Psalms 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases.</p>

<p>For the faithful fail from among the children of men.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Everyone lies to his neighbor.</p>

<p>They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips,</p>

<p>and the tongue that boasts,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail.</p>

<p>Our lips are our own.</p>

<p>Who is lord over us?”</p>

<p><a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> “Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy,</p>

<p>I will now arise,” says Yahweh;</p>

<p>“I will set him in safety from those who malign him.”</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Yahweh’s words are flawless words,</p>

<p>as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> You will keep them, Yahweh.</p>

<p>You will preserve them from this generation forever.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The wicked walk on every side,</p>

<p>when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.</p>
