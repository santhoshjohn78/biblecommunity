<h2>Numbers 28</h2>

<p><a id="c28_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <a id="c28_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> “Command the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘See that you present my offering, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to me, in their due season.’ <a id="c28_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> You shall tell them, ‘This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to Yahweh: male lambs a year old without defect, two day by day, for a continual burnt offering. <a id="c28_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> You shall offer the one lamb in the morning, and you shall offer the other lamb at evening; <a id="c28_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> with one tenth of an ephah<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil. <a id="c28_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh. <a id="c28_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Its drink offering shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb. You shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to Yahweh in the holy place. <a id="c28_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The other lamb you shall offer at evening. As the meal offering of the morning, and as its drink offering, you shall offer it, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> “‘On the Sabbath day, two male lambs a year old without defect, and two tenths of an ephah<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, and its drink offering: <a id="c28_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, besides the continual burnt offering, and its drink offering.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> “‘In the beginnings of your months, you shall offer a burnt offering to Yahweh: two young bulls, and one ram, seven male lambs a year old without defect; <a id="c28_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and three tenths of an ephah<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram; <a id="c28_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and one tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering to every lamb; for a burnt offering of a pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh. <a id="c28_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year. <a id="c28_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> One male goat for a sin offering to Yahweh; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering, and its drink offering.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> “‘In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is Yahweh’s Passover. <a id="c28_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> On the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast. Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days. <a id="c28_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> In the first day shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work; <a id="c28_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> but you shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt offering to Yahweh: two young bulls, and one ram, and seven male lambs a year old; they shall be to you without defect; <a id="c28_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil. You shall offer three tenths for a bull, and two tenths for the ram. <a id="c28_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> You shall offer one tenth for every lamb of the seven lambs; <a id="c28_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you. <a id="c28_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering. <a id="c28_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> In this way you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. It shall be offered in addition to the continual burnt offering, and its drink offering. <a id="c28_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> On the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> “‘Also in the day of the first fruits, when you offer a new meal offering to Yahweh in your feast of weeks, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work; <a id="c28_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> but you shall offer a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh: two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs a year old; <a id="c28_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three tenths for each bull, two tenths for the one ram, <a id="c28_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> one tenth for every lamb of the seven lambs; <a id="c28_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> one male goat, to make atonement for you. <a id="c28_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Besides the continual burnt offering, and its meal offering, you shall offer them and their drink offerings. See that they are without defect.</p>
