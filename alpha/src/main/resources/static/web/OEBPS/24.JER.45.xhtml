<h2>Jeremiah 45</h2>

<p><a id="c45_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, <a id="c45_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch: <a id="c45_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> ‘You said, “Woe is me now! For Yahweh has added sorrow to my pain! I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.”’</p>

<p><a id="c45_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> “You shall tell him, Yahweh says: ‘Behold, that which I have built, I will break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land. <a id="c45_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Do you seek great things for yourself? Don’t seek them; for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh,’ says Yahweh; ‘but your life will I give to you for a prey in all places where you go.’”</p>
