<h2>Psalms 53</h2>

<p><a id="c53_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”</p>

<p>They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity.</p>

<p>There is no one who does good.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> God looks down from heaven on the children of men,</p>

<p>to see if there are any who understood,</p>

<p>who seek after God.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Every one of them has gone back.</p>

<p>They have become filthy together.</p>

<p>There is no one who does good, no, not one.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge,</p>

<p>who eat up my people as they eat bread,</p>

<p>and don’t call on God?</p>

<p><a id="c53_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> There they were in great fear, where no fear was,</p>

<p>for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you.</p>

<p>You have put them to shame,</p>

<p>because God has rejected them.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!</p>

<p>When God brings back his people from captivity,</p>

<p>then Jacob shall rejoice,</p>

<p>and Israel shall be glad.</p>
