<h2>Psalms 126</h2>

<p><a id="c126_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion,</p>

<p>we were like those who dream.</p>

<p><a id="c126_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Then our mouth was filled with laughter,</p>

<p>and our tongue with singing.</p>

<p>Then they said among the nations,</p>

<p>“Yahweh has done great things for them.”</p>

<p><a id="c126_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Yahweh has done great things for us,</p>

<p>and we are glad.</p>

<p><a id="c126_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh,</p>

<p>like the streams in the Negev.</p>

<p><a id="c126_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.</p>

<p><a id="c126_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing,</p>

<p>will certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.</p>
