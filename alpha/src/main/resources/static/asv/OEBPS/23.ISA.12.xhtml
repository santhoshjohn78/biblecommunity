<h2>Isaiah 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And in that day thou shalt say, I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah; for though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away and thou comfortest me. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for Jehovah, even Jehovah, is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And in that day shall ye say, Give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name, declare his doings among the peoples, make mention that his name is exalted. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Sing unto Jehovah; for he hath done excellent things: let this be known in all the earth. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great in the midst of thee is the Holy One of Israel.</p>
