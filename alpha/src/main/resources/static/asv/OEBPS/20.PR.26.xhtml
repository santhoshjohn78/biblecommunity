<h2>Proverbs 26</h2>

<p><a id="c26_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honor is not seemly for a fool. <a id="c26_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> As the sparrow in her wandering, as the swallow in her flying, So the curse that is causeless alighteth not. <a id="c26_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, And a rod for the back of fools. <a id="c26_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Answer not a fool according to his folly, Lest thou also be like unto him. <a id="c26_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own conceit. <a id="c26_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool Cutteth off his own feet, and drinketh in damage. <a id="c26_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The legs of the lame hang loose: So is a parable in the mouth of fools. <a id="c26_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> As one that bindeth a stone in a sling, So is he that giveth honor to a fool. <a id="c26_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> As a thorn that goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, So is a parable in the mouth of fools. <a id="c26_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> As an archer that woundeth all, So is he that hireth a fool and he that hireth them that pass by. <a id="c26_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> As a dog that returneth to his vomit, So is a fool that repeateth his folly. <a id="c26_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool than of him. <a id="c26_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The sluggard saith, There is a lion in the way; A lion is in the streets. <a id="c26_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> As the door turneth upon its hinges, So doth the sluggard upon his bed. <a id="c26_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish; It wearieth him to bring it again to his mouth. <a id="c26_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit Than seven men that can render a reason. <a id="c26_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He that passeth by, and vexeth himself with strife belonging not to him, Is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. <a id="c26_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> As a madman who casteth firebrands, Arrows, and death, <a id="c26_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> So is the man that deceiveth his neighbor, And saith, Am not I in sport? <a id="c26_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For lack of wood the fire goeth out; And where there is no whisperer, contention ceaseth. <a id="c26_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> As coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire, So is a contentious man to inflame strife. <a id="c26_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts. <a id="c26_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Fervent lips and a wicked heart Are like an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross. <a id="c26_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> He that hateth dissembleth with his lips; But he layeth up deceit within him: <a id="c26_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> When he speaketh fair, believe him not; For there are seven abominations in his heart: <a id="c26_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Though his hatred cover itself with guile, His wickedness shall be openly showed before the assembly. <a id="c26_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein; And he that rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him. <a id="c26_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> A lying tongue hateth those whom it hath wounded; And a flattering mouth worketh ruin.</p>
