<h2>Proverbs 22</h2>

<p><a id="c22_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, And loving favor rather than silver and gold. <a id="c22_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The rich and the poor meet together: Jehovah is the maker of them all. <a id="c22_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself; But the simple pass on, and suffer for it. <a id="c22_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The reward of humility and the fear of Jehovah Is riches, and honor, and life. <a id="c22_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse: He that keepeth his soul shall be far from them. <a id="c22_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Train up a child in the way he should go, And even when he is old he will not depart from it. <a id="c22_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The rich ruleth over the poor; And the borrower is servant to the lender. <a id="c22_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He that soweth iniquity shall reap calamity; And the rod of his wrath shall fail. <a id="c22_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; For he giveth of his bread to the poor. <a id="c22_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Cast out the scoffer, and contention will go out; Yea, strife and ignominy will cease. <a id="c22_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> He that loveth pureness of heart, For the grace of his lips the king will be his friend. <a id="c22_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The eyes of Jehovah preserve him that hath knowledge; But he overthroweth the words of the treacherous man. <a id="c22_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The sluggard saith, There is a lion without: I shall be slain in the streets. <a id="c22_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: He that is abhorred of Jehovah shall fall therein. <a id="c22_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; But the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. <a id="c22_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> He that oppresseth the poor to increase his gain, And he that giveth to the rich, shall come only to want.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Incline thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, And apply thy heart unto my knowledge. <a id="c22_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee, If they be established together upon thy lips. <a id="c22_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> That thy trust may be in Jehovah, I have made them known to thee this day, even to thee. <a id="c22_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Have not I written unto thee excellent things Of counsels and knowledge, <a id="c22_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> To make thee know the certainty of the words of truth, That thou mayest carry back words of truth to them that send thee? <a id="c22_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Rob not the poor, because he is poor; Neither oppress the afflicted in the gate: <a id="c22_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> For Jehovah will plead their cause, And despoil of life those that despoil them. <a id="c22_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Make no friendship with a man that is given to anger; And with a wrathful man thou shalt not go: <a id="c22_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Lest thou learn this ways, And get a snare to thy soul. <a id="c22_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Be thou not one of them that strike hands, Or of them that are sureties for debts. <a id="c22_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> If thou hast not wherewith to pay, Why should he take away thy bed from under thee? <a id="c22_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Remove not the ancient landmark, Which thy fathers have set. <a id="c22_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; He shall not stand before mean men.</p>
