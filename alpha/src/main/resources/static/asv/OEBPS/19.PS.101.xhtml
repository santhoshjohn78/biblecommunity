<h2>Psalms 101</h2>

<p><a id="c101_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I will sing of lovingkindness and justice: Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I sing praises. <a id="c101_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way: Oh when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. <a id="c101_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I will set no base thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; It shall not cleave unto me. <a id="c101_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> A perverse heart shall depart from me: I will know no evil thing. <a id="c101_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I destroy: Him that hath a high look and a proud heart will I not suffer. <a id="c101_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall minister unto me. <a id="c101_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes. <a id="c101_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land; To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah.</p>
