<h2>Psalms 146</h2>

<p><a id="c146_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise ye Jehovah. Praise Jehovah, O my soul. <a id="c146_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> While I live will I praise Jehovah: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. <a id="c146_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Put not your trust in princes, Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. <a id="c146_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; In that very day his thoughts perish. <a id="c146_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, Whose hope is in Jehovah his God: <a id="c146_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that in them is; Who keepeth truth for ever; <a id="c146_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Who executeth justice for the oppressed; Who giveth food to the hungry. Jehovah looseth the prisoners; <a id="c146_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Jehovah openeth the eyes of the blind; Jehovah raiseth up them that are bowed down; Jehovah loveth the righteous; <a id="c146_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Jehovah preserveth the sojourners; He upholdeth the fatherless and widow; But the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. <a id="c146_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Jehovah will reign for ever, Thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye Jehovah.</p>
