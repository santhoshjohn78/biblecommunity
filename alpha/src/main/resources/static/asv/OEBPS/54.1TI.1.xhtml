<h2>1 Timothy 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope; <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> unto Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine, <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questionings, rather than a dispensation of God which is in faith; so do I now. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned: <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking; <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently affirm. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully, <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine; <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> I thank him that enabled me, even Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful, appointing me to his service; <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief; <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief: <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all his longsuffering, for an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto eternal life. <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> This charge I commit unto thee, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to thee, that by them thou mayest war the good warfare; <a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith: <a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered unto Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.</p>
