<h2>Proverbs 20</h2>

<p><a id="c20_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler; And whosoever erreth thereby is not wise. <a id="c20_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The terror of a king is as the roaring of a lion: He that provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own life. <a id="c20_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife; But every fool will be quarrelling. <a id="c20_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter; Therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing. <a id="c20_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; But a man of understanding will draw it out. <a id="c20_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Most men will proclaim every one his own kindness; But a faithful man who can find? <a id="c20_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> A righteous man that walketh in his integrity, Blessed are his children after him. <a id="c20_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> A king that sitteth on the throne of judgment Scattereth away all evil with his eyes. <a id="c20_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? <a id="c20_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Diverse weights, and diverse measures, Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah. <a id="c20_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Even a child maketh himself known by his doings, Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right. <a id="c20_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Jehovah hath made even both of them. <a id="c20_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; Open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread. <a id="c20_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> It is bad, it is bad, saith the buyer; But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. <a id="c20_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> There is gold, and abundance of rubies; But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. <a id="c20_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge that is surety for foreigners. <a id="c20_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man; But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. <a id="c20_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Every purpose is established by counsel; And by wise guidance make thou war. <a id="c20_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; Therefore company not with him that openeth wide his lips. <a id="c20_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Whoso curseth his father or his mother, His lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness. <a id="c20_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; But the end thereof shall not be blessed. <a id="c20_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Say not thou, I will recompense evil: Wait for Jehovah, and he will save thee. <a id="c20_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Diverse weights are an abomination to Jehovah; And a false balance is not good. <a id="c20_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> A manâ€™s goings are of Jehovah; How then can man understand his way? <a id="c20_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> It is a snare to a man rashly to say, It is holy, And after vows to make inquiry. <a id="c20_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> A wise king winnoweth the wicked, And bringeth the threshing -wheel over them. <a id="c20_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, Searching all his innermost parts. <a id="c20_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Kindness and truth preserve the king; And his throne is upholden by kindness. <a id="c20_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> The glory of young men is their strength; And the beauty of old men is the hoary head. <a id="c20_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Stripes that wound cleanse away evil; And strokes reach the innermost parts.</p>
