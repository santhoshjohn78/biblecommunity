<h2>Jeremiah 30</h2>

<p><a id="c30_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying, <a id="c30_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thus speaketh Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book. <a id="c30_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For, lo, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith Jehovah; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it. <a id="c30_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And these are the words that Jehovah spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah. <a id="c30_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For thus saith Jehovah: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. <a id="c30_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child: wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? <a id="c30_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it. <a id="c30_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondman; <a id="c30_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> but they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them. <a id="c30_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith Jehovah; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid. <a id="c30_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to save thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in measure, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished. <a id="c30_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For thus saith Jehovah, Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound grievous. <a id="c30_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines. <a id="c30_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased. <a id="c30_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Why criest thou for thy hurt? thy pain is incurable: for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee. <a id="c30_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that despoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey. <a id="c30_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jehovah; because they have called thee an outcast, <a id="c30_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be builded upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner. <a id="c30_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small. <a id="c30_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all that oppress them. <a id="c30_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is he that hath had boldness to approach unto me? saith Jehovah. <a id="c30_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. <a id="c30_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, even his wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked. <a id="c30_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it.</p>
