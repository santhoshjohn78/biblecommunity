<h2>Proverbs 23</h2>

<p><a id="c23_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, Consider diligently him that is before thee; <a id="c23_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And put a knife to thy throat, If thou be a man given to appetite. <a id="c23_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Be not desirous of his dainties; Seeing they are deceitful food. <a id="c23_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Weary not thyself to be rich; Cease from thine own wisdom. <a id="c23_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? For riches certainly make themselves wings, Like an eagle that flieth toward heaven. <a id="c23_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, Neither desire thou his dainties: <a id="c23_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For as he thinketh within himself, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; But his heart is not with thee. <a id="c23_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, And lose thy sweet words. <a id="c23_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Speak not in the hearing of a fool; For he will despise the wisdom of thy words. <a id="c23_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Remove not the ancient landmark; And enter not into the fields of the fatherless: <a id="c23_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their cause against thee. <a id="c23_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Apply thy heart unto instruction, And thine ears to the words of knowledge. <a id="c23_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Withhold not correction from the child; For if thou beat him with the rod, he will not die. <a id="c23_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Thou shalt beat him with the rod, And shalt deliver his soul from Sheol. <a id="c23_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> My son, if thy heart be wise, My heart will be glad, even mine: <a id="c23_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Yea, my heart will rejoice, When thy lips speak right things. <a id="c23_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Let not thy heart envy sinners; But be thou in the fear of Jehovah all the day long: <a id="c23_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For surely there is a reward; And thy hope shall not be cut off. <a id="c23_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And guide thy heart in the way. <a id="c23_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Be not among winebibbers, Among gluttonous eaters of flesh: <a id="c23_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; And drowsiness will clothe a man with rags. <a id="c23_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, And despise not thy mother when she is old. <a id="c23_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Buy the truth, and sell it not; Yea, wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. <a id="c23_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; And he that begetteth a wise child will have joy of him. <a id="c23_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Let thy father and thy mother be glad, And let her that bare thee rejoice. <a id="c23_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> My son, give me thy heart; And let thine eyes delight in my ways. <a id="c23_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> For a harlot is a deep ditch; And a foreign woman is a narrow pit. <a id="c23_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Yea, she lieth in wait as a robber, And increaseth the treacherous among men. <a id="c23_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? Who hath complaining? who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes? <a id="c23_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> They that tarry long at the wine; They that go to seek out mixed wine. <a id="c23_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, When it sparkleth in the cup, When it goeth down smoothly: <a id="c23_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> At the last it biteth like a serpent, And stingeth like an adder. <a id="c23_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Thine eyes shall behold strange things, And thy heart shall utter perverse things. <a id="c23_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. <a id="c23_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not hurt; They have beaten me, and I felt it not: When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</p>
