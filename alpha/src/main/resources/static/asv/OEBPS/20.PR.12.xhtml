<h2>Proverbs 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Whoso loveth correction loveth knowledge; But he that hateth reproof is brutish. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> A good man shall obtain favor of Jehovah; But a man of wicked devices will he condemn. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> A man shall not be established by wickedness; But the root of the righteous shall not be moved. <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> A worthy woman is the crown of her husband; But she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The thoughts of the righteous are just; But the counsels of the wicked are deceit. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The words of the wicked are of lying in wait for blood; But the mouth of the upright shall deliver them. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The wicked are overthrown, and are not; But the house of the righteous shall stand. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> A man shall be commended according to his wisdom; But he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised. <a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Better is he that is lightly esteemed, and hath a servant, Than he that honoreth himself, and lacketh bread. <a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast; But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. <a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread; But he that followeth after vain persons is void of understanding. <a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The wicked desireth the net of evil men; But the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit. <a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> In the transgression of the lips is a snare to the evil man; But the righteous shall come out of trouble. <a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth; And the doings of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him. <a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The way of a fool is right in his own eyes; But he that is wise hearkeneth unto counsel. <a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> A fool’s vexation is presently known; But a prudent man concealeth shame. <a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He that uttereth truth showeth forth righteousness; But a false witness, deceit. <a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> There is that speaketh rashly like the piercings of a sword; But the tongue of the wise is health. <a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The lip of truth shall be established for ever; But a lying tongue is but for a moment. <a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Deceit is in the heart of them that devise evil; But to the counsellors of peace is joy. <a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> There shall no mischief happen to the righteous; But the wicked shall be filled with evil. <a id="c12_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Lying lips are an abomination to Jehovah; But they that deal truly are his delight. <a id="c12_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> A prudent man concealeth knowledge; But the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness. <a id="c12_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The hand of the diligent shall bear rule; But the slothful shall be put under taskwork. <a id="c12_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Heaviness in the heart of a man maketh it stoop; But a good word maketh it glad. <a id="c12_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> The righteous is a guide to his neighbor; But the way of the wicked causeth them to err. <a id="c12_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting; But the precious substance of men is to the diligent. <a id="c12_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> In the way of righteousness is life; And in the pathway thereof there is no death.</p>
