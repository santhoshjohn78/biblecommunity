<h2>Psalms 91</h2>

<p><a id="c91_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. <a id="c91_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in whom I trust. <a id="c91_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, And from the deadly pestilence. <a id="c91_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He will cover thee with his pinions, And under his wings shalt thou take refuge: His truth is a shield and a buckler. <a id="c91_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, Nor for the arrow that flieth by day; <a id="c91_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. <a id="c91_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> A thousand shall fall at thy side, And ten thousand at thy right hand; But it shall not come nigh thee. <a id="c91_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, And see the reward of the wicked. <a id="c91_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For thou, O Jehovah, art my refuge! Thou hast made the Most High thy habitation; <a id="c91_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> There shall no evil befall thee, Neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent. <a id="c91_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For he will give his angels charge over thee, To keep thee in all thy ways. <a id="c91_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> They shall bear thee up in their hands, Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. <a id="c91_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: The young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under foot. <a id="c91_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. <a id="c91_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him, and honor him. <a id="c91_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> With long life will I satisfy him, And show him my salvation.</p>
