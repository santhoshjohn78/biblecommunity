<h2>Zechariah 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses. <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The chariot wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country. <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the strong went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Then cried he to me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, they that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they are come from Babylon; <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> yea, take of them silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest; <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build the temple of Jehovah; <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> even he shall build the temple of Jehovah; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. <a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah. <a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah your God.</p>
