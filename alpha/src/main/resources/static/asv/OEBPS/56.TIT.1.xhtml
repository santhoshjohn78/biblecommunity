<h2>Titus 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal; <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour; <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge; <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly. <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For the bishop must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled; <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers. <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision, <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons. <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>
