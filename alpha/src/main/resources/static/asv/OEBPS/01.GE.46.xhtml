<h2>Genesis 46</h2>

<p><a id="c46_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. <a id="c46_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I. <a id="c46_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: <a id="c46_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. <a id="c46_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. <a id="c46_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: <a id="c46_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> his sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s first-born. <a id="c46_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. <a id="c46_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. <a id="c46_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. <a id="c46_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. <a id="c46_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron. <a id="c46_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. <a id="c46_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> These are the sons of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three. <a id="c46_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. <a id="c46_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel. <a id="c46_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls. <a id="c46_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin. <a id="c46_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him. <a id="c46_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. <a id="c46_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. <a id="c46_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And the sons of Dan: Hushim. <a id="c46_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. <a id="c46_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob: all the souls were seven. <a id="c46_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls were threescore and six; <a id="c46_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. <a id="c46_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. <a id="c46_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive. <a id="c46_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father’s house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; <a id="c46_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. <a id="c46_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation? <a id="c46_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>
