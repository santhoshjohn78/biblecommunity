<h2>2 Timothy 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands. <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God; <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day. <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> That good thing which was committed unto thee guard through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> (the Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p>
