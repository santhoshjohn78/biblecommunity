<h2>Job 25</h2>

<p><a id="c25_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, <a id="c25_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Dominion and fear are with him; He maketh peace in his high places. <a id="c25_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Is there any number of his armies? And upon whom doth not his light arise? <a id="c25_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> How then can man be just with God? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? <a id="c25_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, And the stars are not pure in his sight: <a id="c25_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> How much less man, that is a worm! And the son of man, that is a worm!</p>
