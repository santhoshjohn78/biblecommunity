<h2>Philippians 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you, <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy, <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now; <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ: <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus. <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment; <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ; <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel; <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest; <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> the one do it of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel; <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds. <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. <a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, <a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death. <a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. <a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But if to live in the flesh, -- if this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not. <a id="c1_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better: <a id="c1_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake. <a id="c1_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith; <a id="c1_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again. <a id="c1_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you and be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel; <a id="c1_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God; <a id="c1_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf: <a id="c1_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</p>
