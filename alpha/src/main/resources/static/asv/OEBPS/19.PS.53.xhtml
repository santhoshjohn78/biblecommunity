<h2>Psalms 53</h2>

<p><a id="c53_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity; There is none that doeth good. <a id="c53_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God. <a id="c53_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Every one of them is gone back; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one. <a id="c53_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And call not upon God? <a id="c53_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> There were they in great fear, where no fear was; For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: Thou hast put them to shame, because of God hath rejected them. <a id="c53_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p>
