<h2>1 Corinthians 13</h2>

<p><a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal. <a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. <a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And if I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing. <a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, <a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil; <a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth; <a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. <a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall be done away. <a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For we know in part, and we prophesy in part; <a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away. <a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things. <a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known. <a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.</p>
