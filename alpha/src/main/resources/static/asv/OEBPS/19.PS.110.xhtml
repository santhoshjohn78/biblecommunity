<h2>Psalms 110</h2>

<p><a id="c110_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, Until I make thine enemies thy footstool. <a id="c110_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. <a id="c110_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thy people offer themselves willingly In the day of thy power, in holy array: Out of the womb of the morning Thou hast the dew of thy youth. <a id="c110_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek. <a id="c110_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The Lord at thy right hand Will strike through kings in the day of his wrath. <a id="c110_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He will judge among the nations, He will fill the places with dead bodies; He will strike through the head in many countries. <a id="c110_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He will drink of the brook in the way: Therefore will he lift up the head.</p>
