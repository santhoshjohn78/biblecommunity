<h2>Psalms 93</h2>

<p><a id="c93_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah reigneth; he is clothed with majesty; Jehovah is clothed with strength; he hath girded himself therewith: The world also is established, that it cannot be moved. <a id="c93_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thy throne is established of old: Thou art from everlasting. <a id="c93_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves. <a id="c93_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Above the voices of many waters, The mighty breakers of the sea, Jehovah on high is mighty. <a id="c93_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thy testimonies are very sure: Holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for evermore.</p>
