<h2>Proverbs 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> My son, if thou wilt receive my words, And lay up my commandments with thee; <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> So as to incline thine ear unto wisdom, And apply thy heart to understanding; <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Yea, if thou cry after discernment, And lift up thy voice for understanding; <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> If thou seek her as silver, And search for her as for hid treasures: <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, And find the knowledge of God. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For Jehovah giveth wisdom; Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding: <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to them that walk in integrity; <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> That he may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of his saints. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, And equity, yea, every good path. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul; <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Discretion shall watch over thee; Understanding shall keep thee: <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> To deliver thee from the way of evil, From the men that speak perverse things; <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness; <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the perverseness of evil; <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Who are crooked in their ways, And wayward in their paths: <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> To deliver thee from the strange woman, Even from the foreigner that flattereth with her words; <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> That forsaketh the friend of her youth, And forgetteth the covenant of her God: <a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For her house inclineth unto death, And her paths unto the dead; <a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> None that go unto her return again, Neither do they attain unto the paths of life: <a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous. <a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For the upright shall dwell in the land, And the perfect shall remain in it. <a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, And the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.</p>
