<h2>Psalms 24</h2>

<p><a id="c24_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The earth is Jehovahâ€™s, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein. <a id="c24_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For he hath founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the floods. <a id="c24_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Who shall ascend into the hill of Jehovah? And who shall stand in his holy place? <a id="c24_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; Who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood, And hath not sworn deceitfully. <a id="c24_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He shall receive a blessing from Jehovah, And righteousness from the God of his salvation. <a id="c24_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> This is the generation of them that seek after him, That seek thy face, even Jacob.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in. <a id="c24_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Who is the King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle. <a id="c24_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; Yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in. <a id="c24_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Who is this King of glory? Jehovah of hosts, He is the King of glory.</p>
