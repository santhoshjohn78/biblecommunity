<h2>Deuteronomy 34</h2>

<p><a id="c34_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, <a id="c34_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the hinder sea, <a id="c34_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm-trees, unto Zoar. <a id="c34_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Jehovah said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither. <a id="c34_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Jehovah. <a id="c34_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. <a id="c34_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. <a id="c34_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended.</p>

<p><a id="c34_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as Jehovah commanded Moses. <a id="c34_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face, <a id="c34_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> in all the signs and the wonders, which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, <a id="c34_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.</p>
