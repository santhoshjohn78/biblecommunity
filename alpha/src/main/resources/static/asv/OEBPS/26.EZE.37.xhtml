<h2>Ezekiel 37</h2>

<p><a id="c37_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones. <a id="c37_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. <a id="c37_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest. <a id="c37_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah. <a id="c37_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live. <a id="c37_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. <a id="c37_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone. <a id="c37_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them. <a id="c37_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. <a id="c37_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. <a id="c37_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off. <a id="c37_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel. <a id="c37_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people. <a id="c37_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, saith Jehovah. <a id="c37_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying, <a id="c37_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions: <a id="c37_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand. <a id="c37_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these? <a id="c37_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand. <a id="c37_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes. <a id="c37_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land: <a id="c37_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all; <a id="c37_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God. <a id="c37_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in mine ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them. <a id="c37_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their childrenâ€™s children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever. <a id="c37_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. <a id="c37_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. <a id="c37_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.</p>
