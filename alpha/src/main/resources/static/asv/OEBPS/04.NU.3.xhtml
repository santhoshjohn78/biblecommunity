<h2>Numbers 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Jehovah spake with Moses in mount Sinai. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the first-born, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests that were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Nadab and Abihu died before Jehovah, when they offered strange fire before Jehovah, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children; and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office in the presence of Aaron their father.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And they shall keep all the furniture of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are wholly given unto him on the behalf of the children of Israel. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall keep their priesthood: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the first-born that openeth the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine: <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> for all the first-born are mine; on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the first-born in Israel, both man and beast; mine they shall be: I am Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Number the children of Levi by their fathers’ houses, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Moses numbered them according to the word of Jehovah, as he was commanded. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei. <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram, and Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And the sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi.
