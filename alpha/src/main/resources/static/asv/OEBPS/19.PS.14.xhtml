<h2>Psalms 14</h2>

<p><a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; There is none that doeth good. <a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God. <a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one. <a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And call not upon Jehovah? <a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> There were they in great fear; For God is in the generation of the righteous. <a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor, Because Jehovah is his refuge. <a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p>
