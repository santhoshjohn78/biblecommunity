<h2>Zechariah 9</h2>

<p><a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The burden of the word of Jehovah upon the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be its resting-place (for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Jehovah); <a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and Hamath, also, which bordereth thereon; Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise. <a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. <a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. <a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also, and shall be sore pained; and Ekron, for her expectation shall be put to shame; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. <a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. <a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; and he also shall be a remnant for our God; and he shall be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite. <a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I will encamp about my house against the army, that none pass through or return; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes. <a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy king cometh unto thee; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass. <a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace unto the nations: and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. <a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I have set free thy prisoners from the pit wherein is no water. <a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even to-day do I declare that I will render double unto thee. <a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man. <a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Jehovah shall be seen over them; and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south. <a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Jehovah of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, like the corners of the altar. <a id="c9_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Jehovah their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people; for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted on high over his land. <a id="c9_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.</p>
