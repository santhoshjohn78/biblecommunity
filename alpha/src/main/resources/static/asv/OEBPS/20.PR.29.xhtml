<h2>Proverbs 29</h2>

<p><a id="c29_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck Shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. <a id="c29_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> When the righteous are increased, the people rejoice; But when a wicked man beareth rule, the people sigh. <a id="c29_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father; But he that keepeth company with harlots wasteth his substance. <a id="c29_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The king by justice establisheth the land; But he that exacteth gifts overthroweth it. <a id="c29_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> A man that flattereth his neighbor Spreadeth a net for his steps. <a id="c29_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare; But the righteous doth sing and rejoice. <a id="c29_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The righteous taketh knowledge of the cause of the poor; The wicked hath not understanding to know it. <a id="c29_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Scoffers set a city in a flame; But wise men turn away wrath. <a id="c29_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> If a wise man hath a controversy with a foolish man, Whether he be angry or laugh, there will be no rest. <a id="c29_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The bloodthirsty hate him that is perfect; And as for the upright, they seek his life. <a id="c29_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> A fool uttereth all his anger; But a wise man keepeth it back and stilleth it. <a id="c29_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> If a ruler hearkeneth to falsehood, All his servants are wicked. <a id="c29_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The poor man and the oppressor meet together; Jehovah lighteneth the eyes of them both. <a id="c29_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, His throne shall be established for ever. <a id="c29_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The rod and reproof give wisdom; But a child left to himself causeth shame to his mother. <a id="c29_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> When the wicked are increased, transgression increaseth; But the righteous shall look upon their fall. <a id="c29_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Correct thy son, and he will give thee rest; Yea, he will give delight unto thy soul. <a id="c29_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint; But he that keepeth the law, happy is he. <a id="c29_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> A servant will not be corrected by words; For though he understand, he will not give heed. <a id="c29_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? There is more hope of a fool than of him. <a id="c29_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child Shall have him become a son at the last. <a id="c29_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> An angry man stirreth up strife, And a wrathful man aboundeth in transgression. <a id="c29_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> A man’s pride shall bring him low; But he that is of a lowly spirit shall obtain honor. <a id="c29_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul; He heareth the adjuration and uttereth nothing. <a id="c29_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The fear of man bringeth a snare; But whoso putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be safe. <a id="c29_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Many seek the ruler’s favor; But a man’s judgment cometh from Jehovah. <a id="c29_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous; And he that is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.</p>
