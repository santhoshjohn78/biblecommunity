<h2>Proverbs 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, Than a house full of feasting with strife. <a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> A servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, And shall have part in the inheritance among the brethren. <a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; But Jehovah trieth the hearts. <a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> An evil-doer giveth heed to wicked lips; And a liar giveth ear to a mischievous tongue. <a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker; And he that is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished. <a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Childrenâ€™s children are the crown of old men; And the glory of children are their fathers. <a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Excellent speech becometh not a fool; Much less do lying lips a prince. <a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> A bribe is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it; Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. <a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; But he that harpeth on a matter separateth chief friends. <a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> A rebuke entereth deeper into one that hath understanding Than a hundred stripes into a fool. <a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> An evil man seeketh only rebellion; Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. <a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, Rather than a fool in his folly. <a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Whoso rewardeth evil for good, Evil shall not depart from his house. <a id="c17_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: Therefore leave off contention, before there is quarrelling. <a id="c17_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous, Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah. <a id="c17_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, Seeing he hath no understanding? <a id="c17_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> A friend loveth at all times; And a brother is born for adversity. <a id="c17_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> A man void of understanding striketh hands, And becometh surety in the presence of his neighbor. <a id="c17_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> He loveth transgression that loveth strife: He that raiseth high his gate seeketh destruction. <a id="c17_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> He that hath a wayward heart findeth no good; And he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. <a id="c17_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow; And the father of a fool hath no joy. <a id="c17_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> A cheerful heart is a good medicine; But a broken spirit drieth up the bones. <a id="c17_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> A wicked man receiveth a bribe out of the bosom, To pervert the ways of justice. <a id="c17_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Wisdom is before the face of him that hath understanding; But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. <a id="c17_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> A foolish son is a grief to his father, And bitterness to her that bare him. <a id="c17_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Also to punish the righteous is not good, Nor to smite the noble for their uprightness. <a id="c17_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> He that spareth his words hath knowledge; And he that is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding. <a id="c17_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise; When he shutteth his lips, he is esteemed as prudent.</p>
