<h2>Psalms 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Help, Jehovah; for the godly man ceaseth; For the faithful fail from among the children of men. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> They speak falsehood every one with his neighbor: With flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips, The tongue that speaketh great things; <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; Our lips are our own: who is lord over us? <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy, Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; I will set him in the safety he panteth for. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The words of Jehovah are pure words; As silver tried in a furnace on the earth, Purified seven times. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Thou wilt keep them, O Jehovah, Thou wilt preserve them from this generation for ever. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The wicked walk on every side, When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.</p>
