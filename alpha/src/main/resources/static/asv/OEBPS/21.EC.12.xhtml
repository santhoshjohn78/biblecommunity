<h2>Ecclesiastes 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Remember also thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars, are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain; <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows shall be darkened, <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and the doors shall be shut in the street; when the sound of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low; <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> yea, they shall be afraid of that which is high, and terrors shall be in the way; and the almond-tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets: <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern, <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit returneth unto God who gave it. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity. <a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he pondered, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs. <a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written uprightly, even words of truth. <a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The words of the wise are as goads; and as nails well fastened are the words of the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd. <a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh. <a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> This is the end of the matter; all hath been heard: fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man. <a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</p>
