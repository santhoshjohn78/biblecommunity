<h2>1 Corinthians 16</h2>

<p><a id="c16_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye. <a id="c16_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come. <a id="c16_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And when I arrive, whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send with letters to carry your bounty unto Jerusalem: <a id="c16_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with me. <a id="c16_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia; <a id="c16_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> but with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter, that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I go. <a id="c16_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For I do not wish to see you now by the way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. <a id="c16_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost; <a id="c16_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries. <a id="c16_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do: <a id="c16_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren. <a id="c16_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not all his will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity. <a id="c16_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. <a id="c16_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Let all that ye do be done in love. <a id="c16_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints), <a id="c16_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth. <a id="c16_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they supplied. <a id="c16_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For they refreshed my spirit and yours: acknowledge ye therefore them that are such. <a id="c16_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. <a id="c16_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss. <a id="c16_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. <a id="c16_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema. Maranatha. <a id="c16_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. <a id="c16_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
