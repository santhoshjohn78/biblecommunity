<h2>Proverbs 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A false balance is an abomination to Jehovah; But a just weight is his delight. <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> When pride cometh, then cometh shame; But with the lowly is wisdom. <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The integrity of the upright shall guide them; But the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them. <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Riches profit not in the day of wrath; But righteousness delivereth from death. <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way; But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them; But the treacherous shall be taken in their own iniquity. <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish; And the hope of iniquity perisheth. <a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The righteous is delivered out of trouble, And the wicked cometh in his stead. <a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> With his mouth the godless man destroyeth his neighbor; But through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered. <a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth; And when the wicked perish, there is shouting. <a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted; But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. <a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> He that despiseth his neighbor is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding holdeth his peace. <a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; But he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter. <a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Where no wise guidance is, the people falleth; But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety. <a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it; But he that hateth suretyship is secure. <a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> A gracious woman obtaineth honor; And violent men obtain riches. <a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The merciful man doeth good to his own soul; But he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh. <a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The wicked earneth deceitful wages; But he that soweth righteousness hath a sure reward. <a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> He that is stedfast in righteousness shall attain unto life; And he that pursueth evil doeth it to his own death. <a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> They that are perverse in heart are an abomination to Jehovah; But such as are perfect in their way are his delight. <a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Though hand join in hand, the evil man shall not be unpunished; But the seed of the righteous shall be delivered. <a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> As a ring of gold in a swineâ€™s snout, So is a fair woman that is without discretion. <a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The desire of the righteous is only good; But the expectation of the wicked is wrath. <a id="c11_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> There is that scattereth, and increaseth yet more; And there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth only to want. <a id="c11_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The liberal soul shall be made fat; And he that watereth shall be watered also himself. <a id="c11_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> He that withholdeth grain, the people shall curse him; But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it. <a id="c11_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> He that diligently seeketh good seeketh favor; But he that searcheth after evil, it shall come unto him. <a id="c11_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; But the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf. <a id="c11_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; And the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart. <a id="c11_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; And he that is wise winneth souls. <a id="c11_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: How much more the wicked and the sinner!</p>
