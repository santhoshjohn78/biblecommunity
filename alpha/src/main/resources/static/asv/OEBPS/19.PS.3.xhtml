<h2>Psalms 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased! Many are they that rise up against me. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Many there are that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me; My glory and the lifter up of my head. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I cry unto Jehovah with my voice, And he answereth me out of his holy hill.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people That have set themselves against me round about. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God: For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah: Thy blessing be upon thy people.</p>
