<h2>1 Timothy 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men; <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity. <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> who would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus, <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony to be borne in its own times; <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment; <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> but (which becometh women professing godliness) through good works. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness. <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For Adam was first formed, then Eve; <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression: <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> but she shall be saved through her child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.</p>
