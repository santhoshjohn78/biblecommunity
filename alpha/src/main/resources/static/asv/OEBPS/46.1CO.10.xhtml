<h2>1 Corinthians 10</h2>

<p><a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; <a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; <a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and did all eat the same spiritual food; <a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ. <a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. <a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. <a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. <a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. <a id="c10_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents. <a id="c10_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer. <a id="c10_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come. <a id="c10_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. <a id="c10_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it. <a id="c10_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. <a id="c10_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. <a id="c10_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ? <a id="c10_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we are all partake of the one bread. <a id="c10_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar? <a id="c10_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? <a id="c10_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons. <a id="c10_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons. <a id="c10_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? <a id="c10_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify. <a id="c10_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Let no man seek his own, but each his neighbor’s good. <a id="c10_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake, <a id="c10_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof. <a id="c10_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> If one of them that believe not biddeth you to a feast, and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake. <a id="c10_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake: <a id="c10_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other’s; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience? <a id="c10_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? <a id="c10_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. <a id="c10_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> Give no occasions of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God: <a id="c10_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.</p>
