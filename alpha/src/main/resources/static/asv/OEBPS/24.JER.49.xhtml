<h2>Jeremiah 49</h2>

<p><a id="c49_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Of the children of Ammon. Thus saith Jehovah: Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth Malcam possess Gad, and his people well in the cities thereof? <a id="c49_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess them that did possess him, saith Jehovah. <a id="c49_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and run to and fro among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together. <a id="c49_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me? <a id="c49_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, from all that are round about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives. <a id="c49_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith Jehovah. <a id="c49_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Of Edom. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished? <a id="c49_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Flee ye, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I shall visit him. <a id="c49_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> If grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough? <a id="c49_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brethren, and his neighbors; and he is not. <a id="c49_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me. <a id="c49_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink. <a id="c49_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For I have sworn by myself, saith Jehovah, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes. <a id="c49_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I have heard tidings from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, saying, Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle. <a id="c49_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For, behold, I have made thee small among the nations, and despised among men. <a id="c49_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> As for thy terribleness, the pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith Jehovah. <a id="c49_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Edom shall become an astonishment: every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. <a id="c49_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein. <a id="c49_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that will stand before me? <a id="c49_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them. <a id="c49_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> The earth trembleth at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea. <a id="c49_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. <a id="c49_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet. <a id="c49_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Damascus is waxed feeble, she turneth herself to flee, and trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail. <a id="c49_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy? <a id="c49_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts. <a id="c49_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad. <a id="c49_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote. Thus saith Jehovah: Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east. <a id="c49_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Terror on every side! <a id="c49_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Flee ye, wander far off, dwell in the depths, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith Jehovah; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. <a id="c49_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Arise, get you up unto a nation that is at ease, that dwelleth without care, saith Jehovah; that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone. <a id="c49_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter unto all winds them that have the corners of their hair cut off; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, saith Jehovah. <a id="c49_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals, a desolation for ever: no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein. <a id="c49_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, <a id="c49_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might. <a id="c49_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. <a id="c49_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith Jehovah; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them; <a id="c49_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence king and princes, saith Jehovah. <a id="c49_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, saith Jehovah.</p>
