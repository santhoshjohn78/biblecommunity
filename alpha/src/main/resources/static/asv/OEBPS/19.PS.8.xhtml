<h2>Psalms 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth, Who hast set thy glory upon the heavens! <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength, Because of thine adversaries, That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. <a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him? <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For thou hast made him but little lower than God, And crownest him with glory and honor. <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet: <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of the field, <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth!</p>
