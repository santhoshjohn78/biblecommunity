<h2>Proverbs 18</h2>

<p><a id="c18_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> He that separateth himself seeketh his own desire, And rageth against all sound wisdom. <a id="c18_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> A fool hath no delight in understanding, But only that his heart may reveal itself. <a id="c18_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> When the wicked cometh, there cometh also contempt, And with ignominy cometh reproach. <a id="c18_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters; The wellspring of wisdom is as a flowing brook. <a id="c18_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> To respect the person of the wicked is not good, Nor to turn aside the righteous in judgment. <a id="c18_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> A fool’s lips enter into contention, And his mouth calleth for stripes. <a id="c18_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> A fool’s mouth is his destruction, And his lips are the snare of his soul. <a id="c18_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts. <a id="c18_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He also that is slack in his work Is brother to him that is a destroyer. <a id="c18_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; The righteous runneth into it, and is safe. <a id="c18_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, And as a high wall in his own imagination. <a id="c18_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Before destruction the heart of man is haughty; And before honor goeth humility. <a id="c18_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He that giveth answer before he heareth, It is folly and shame unto him. <a id="c18_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; But a broken spirit who can bear? <a id="c18_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. <a id="c18_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> A man’s gift maketh room for him, And bringeth him before great men. <a id="c18_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He that pleadeth his cause first seemeth just; But his neighbor cometh and searcheth him out. <a id="c18_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The lot causeth contentions to cease, And parteth between the mighty. <a id="c18_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city; And such contentions are like the bars of a castle. <a id="c18_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth; With the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied. <a id="c18_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Death and life are in the power of the tongue; And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. <a id="c18_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, And obtaineth favor of Jehovah. <a id="c18_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The poor useth entreaties; But the rich answereth roughly. <a id="c18_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> He that maketh many friends doeth it to his own destruction; But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.</p>
