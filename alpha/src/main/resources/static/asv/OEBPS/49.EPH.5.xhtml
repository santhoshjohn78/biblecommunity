<h2>Ephesians 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children; <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints; <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Be not ye therefore partakers with them; <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> (for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth), <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord; <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them; <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of. <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Wherefore he saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee. <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise; <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> redeeming the time, because the days are evil. <a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. <a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit; <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father; <a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ. <a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. <a id="c5_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, being himself the saviour of the body. <a id="c5_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> But as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything. <a id="c5_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it; <a id="c5_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word, <a id="c5_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> that he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. <a id="c5_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself: <a id="c5_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church; <a id="c5_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> because we are members of his body. <a id="c5_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh. <a id="c5_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church. <a id="c5_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she fear her husband.</p>
