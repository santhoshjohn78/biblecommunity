<h2>1 Corinthians 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one of you hath his fatherâ€™s wife. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing, <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators; <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> not at all meaning with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world: <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within? <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But them that are without God judgeth. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.</p>
