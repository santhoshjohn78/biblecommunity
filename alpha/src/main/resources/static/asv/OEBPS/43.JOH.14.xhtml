<h2>John 14</h2>

<p><a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, believe also in me. <a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. <a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And if I go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and will receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. <a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And whither I go, ye know the way. <a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; how know we the way? <a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father, but by me. <a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. <a id="c14_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. <a id="c14_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou, Show us the Father? <a id="c14_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I say unto you I speak not from myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his works. <a id="c14_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake. <a id="c14_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto the Father. <a id="c14_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. <a id="c14_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> If ye shall ask anything in my name, that will I do. <a id="c14_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> If ye love me, ye will keep my commandments. <a id="c14_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, <a id="c14_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> even the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you. <a id="c14_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> I will not leave you desolate: I come unto you. <a id="c14_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Yet a little while, and the world beholdeth me no more; but ye behold me: because I live, ye shall live also. <a id="c14_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. <a id="c14_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him. <a id="c14_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Judas (not Iscariot) saith unto him, Lord, what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? <a id="c14_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. <a id="c14_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> He that loveth me not keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me. <a id="c14_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> These things have I spoken unto you, while yet abiding with you. <a id="c14_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> But the Comforter, even the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you. <a id="c14_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful. <a id="c14_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Ye heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I. <a id="c14_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe. <a id="c14_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he hath nothing in me; <a id="c14_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.</p>
