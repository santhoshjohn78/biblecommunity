<h2>Psalms 99</h2>

<p><a id="c99_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah reigneth; let the peoples tremble: He sitteth above the cherubim; let the earth be moved. <a id="c99_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah is great in Zion; And he is high above all the peoples. <a id="c99_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Let them praise thy great and terrible name: Holy is he.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The kingâ€™s strength also loveth justice; Thou dost establish equity; Thou executest justice and righteousness in Jacob. <a id="c99_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his footstool: Holy is he.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Moses and Aaron among his priests, And Samuel among them that call upon his name; They called upon Jehovah, and he answered them. <a id="c99_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: They kept his testimonies, And the statute that he gave them. <a id="c99_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Thou answeredst them, O Jehovah our God: Thou wast a God that forgavest them, Though thou tookest vengeance of their doings. <a id="c99_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his holy hill; For Jehovah our God is holy.</p>
