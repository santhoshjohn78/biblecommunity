<h2>Psalms 70</h2>

<p><a id="c70_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Make haste, O God, to deliver me; Make haste to help me, O Jehovah. <a id="c70_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let them be put to shame and confounded That seek after my soul: Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor That delight in my hurt. <a id="c70_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Let them be turned back by reason of their shame That say, Aha, aha. <a id="c70_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; And let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. <a id="c70_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But I am poor and needy; Make haste unto me, O God: Thou art my help and my deliverer; O Jehovah, make no tarrying.</p>
