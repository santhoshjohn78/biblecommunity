<h2>2 Timothy 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good, <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power therefore. From these also turn away. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts, <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But they shall proceed no further. For their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience, <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> persecutions, sufferings. What things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> That the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.</p>
