<h2>Isaiah 62</h2>

<p><a id="c62_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that burneth. <a id="c62_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory, and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall name. <a id="c62_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. <a id="c62_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah; for Jehovah delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married. <a id="c62_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee; and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee. <a id="c62_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that are Jehovah’s remembrancers, take ye no rest, <a id="c62_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. <a id="c62_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy grain to be food for thine enemies; and foreigners shall not drink thy new wine, for which thou hast labored: <a id="c62_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> but they that have garnered it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah; and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary. <a id="c62_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up an ensign for the peoples. <a id="c62_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Behold, Jehovah hath proclaimed unto the end of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him. <a id="c62_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And they shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of Jehovah: and thou shalt be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.</p>
