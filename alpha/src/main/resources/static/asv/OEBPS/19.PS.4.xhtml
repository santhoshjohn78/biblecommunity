<h2>Psalms 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; Thou hast set me at large when I was in distress: Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? How long will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood?</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But know that Jehovah hath set apart for himself him that is godly: Jehovah will hear when I call unto him. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Stand in awe, and sin not: Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And put your trust in Jehovah. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Many there are that say, Who will show us any good? Jehovah, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, More than they have when their grain and their new wine are increased. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; For thou, Jehovah, alone makest me dwell in safety.</p>
