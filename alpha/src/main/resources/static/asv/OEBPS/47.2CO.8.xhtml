<h2>2 Corinthians 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the churches of Macedonia; <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. <a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord, <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints: <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and this, not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God. <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also. <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also. <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love. <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich. <a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And herein I give my judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will. <a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But now complete the doing also; that as there was the readiness to will, so there may be the completion also out of your ability. <a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according as a man hath, not according as he hath not. <a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For I say not this that others may be eased and ye distressed; <a id="c8_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> but by equality: your abundance being a supply at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become <a id="c8_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> as it is written, He that gathered much had nothing over; and he that gathered little had no lack. <a id="c8_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> But thanks be to God, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. <a id="c8_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord. <a id="c8_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is spread through all the churches; <a id="c8_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in the matter of this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and to show our readiness: <a id="c8_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Avoiding this, that any man should blame us in the matter of this bounty which is ministered by us: <a id="c8_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. <a id="c8_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he hath in you. <a id="c8_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Whether any inquire about Titus, he is my partner and my fellow-worker to you-ward, or our brethren, <a id="c8_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Show ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf.</p>
