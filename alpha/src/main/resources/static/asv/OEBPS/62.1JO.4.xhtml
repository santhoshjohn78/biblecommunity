<h2>1 John 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and every spirit that confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the spirit of the antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Ye are of God, my little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They are of the world: therefore speak they as of the world, and the world heareth them. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Herein was the love of God manifested in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us: <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And we know and have believed the love which God hath in us. God is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth in him. <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we in this world. <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love. <a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> We love, because he first loved us. <a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen. <a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also.</p>
