<h2>Philippians 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content. <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Howbeit ye did well that ye had fellowship with my affliction. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but ye only; <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need. <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account. <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, and odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God. <a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And my God shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. <a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Now unto our God and Father be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. <a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you. <a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesarâ€™s household. <a id="c4_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
