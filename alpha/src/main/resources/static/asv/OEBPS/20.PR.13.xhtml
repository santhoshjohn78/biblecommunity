<h2>Proverbs 13</h2>

<p><a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A wise son heareth his father’s instruction; But a scoffer heareth not rebuke. <a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth; But the soul of the treacherous shall eat violence. <a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He that guardeth his mouth keepeth his life; But he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction. <a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing; But the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. <a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> A righteous man hateth lying; But a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame. <a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Righteousness guardeth him that is upright in the way; But wickedness overthroweth the sinner. <a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: There is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great wealth. <a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The ransom of a man’s life is his riches; But the poor heareth no threatening. <a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The light of the righteous rejoiceth; But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. <a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> By pride cometh only contention; But with the well-advised is wisdom. <a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished; But he that gathereth by labor shall have increase. <a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Hope deferred maketh the heart sick; But when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life. <a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Whoso despiseth the word bringeth destruction on himself; But he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. <a id="c13_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The law of the wise is a fountain of life, That one may depart from the snares of death. <a id="c13_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Good understanding giveth favor; But the way of the transgressor is hard. <a id="c13_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Every prudent man worketh with knowledge; But a fool flaunteth his folly. <a id="c13_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> A wicked messenger falleth into evil; But a faithful ambassador is health. <a id="c13_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth correction; But he that regardeth reproof shall be honored. <a id="c13_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul; But it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil. <a id="c13_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Walk with wise men, and thou shalt be wise; But the companion of fools shall smart for it. <a id="c13_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Evil pursueth sinners; But the righteous shall be recompensed with good. <a id="c13_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children’s children; And the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous. <a id="c13_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Much food is in the tillage of the poor; But there is that is destroyed by reason of injustice. <a id="c13_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> He that spareth his rod hateth his son; But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. <a id="c13_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul; But the belly of the wicked shall want.</p>
