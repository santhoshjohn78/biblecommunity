<h2>1 Corinthians 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Ye know that when ye were Gentiles ye were led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might led. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit. <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit: <a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit; <a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues: <a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will. <a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. <a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit. <a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For the body is not one member, but many. <a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. <a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. <a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? <a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him. <a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And if they were all one member, where were the body? <a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> But now they are many members, but one body. <a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. <a id="c12_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary: <a id="c12_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and those parts of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness; <a id="c12_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> whereas our comely parts have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that part which lacked; <a id="c12_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. <a id="c12_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. <a id="c12_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof. <a id="c12_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, divers kinds of tongues. <a id="c12_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? <a id="c12_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? <a id="c12_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you.</p>
