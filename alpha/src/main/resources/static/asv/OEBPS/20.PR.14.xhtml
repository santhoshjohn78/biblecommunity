<h2>Proverbs 14</h2>

<p><a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Every wise woman buildeth her house; But the foolish plucketh it down with her own hands. <a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> He that walketh in his uprightness feareth Jehovah; But he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him. <a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> In the mouth of the foolish is a rod for his pride; But the lips of the wise shall preserve them. <a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Where no oxen are, the crib is clean; But much increase is by the strength of the ox. <a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> A faithful witness will not lie; But a false witness uttereth lies. <a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> A scoffer seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not; But knowledge is easy unto him that hath understanding. <a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Go into the presence of a foolish man, And thou shalt not perceive in him the lips of knowledge. <a id="c14_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way; But the folly of fools is deceit. <a id="c14_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> A trespass-offering mocketh fools; But among the upright there is good will. <a id="c14_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The heart knoweth its own bitterness; And a stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy. <a id="c14_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The house of the wicked shall be overthrown; But the tent of the upright shall flourish. <a id="c14_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> There is a way which seemeth right unto a man; But the end thereof are the ways of death. <a id="c14_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; And the end of mirth is heaviness. <a id="c14_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways; And a good man shall be satisfied from himself. <a id="c14_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The simple believeth every word; But the prudent man looketh well to his going. <a id="c14_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil; But the fool beareth himself insolently, and is confident. <a id="c14_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He that is soon angry will deal foolishly; And a man of wicked devices is hated. <a id="c14_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The simple inherit folly; But the prudent are crowned with knowledge. <a id="c14_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The evil bow down before the good; And the wicked, at the gates of the righteous. <a id="c14_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> The poor is hated even of his own neighbor; But the rich hath many friends. <a id="c14_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> He that despiseth his neighbor sinneth; But he that hath pity on the poor, happy is he. <a id="c14_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Do they not err that devise evil? But mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good. <a id="c14_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> In all labor there is profit; But the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury. <a id="c14_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The crown of the wise is their riches; But the folly of fools is only folly. <a id="c14_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> A true witness delivereth souls; But he that uttereth lies causeth deceit. <a id="c14_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> In the fear of Jehovah is strong confidence; And his children shall have a place of refuge. <a id="c14_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, That one may depart from the snares of death. <a id="c14_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> In the multitude of people is the king’s glory; But in the want of people is the destruction of the prince. <a id="c14_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> He that is slow to anger is of great understanding; But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly. <a id="c14_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> A tranquil heart is the life of the flesh; But envy is the rottenness of the bones. <a id="c14_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker; But he that hath mercy on the needy honoreth him. <a id="c14_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> The wicked is thrust down in his evil-doing; But the righteous hath a refuge in his death. <a id="c14_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding; But that which is in the inward part of fools is made known. <a id="c14_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Righteousness exalteth a nation; But sin is a reproach to any people. <a id="c14_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> The king’s favor is toward a servant that dealeth wisely; But his wrath will be against him that causeth shame.</p>
