<h2>Psalms 20</h2>

<p><a id="c20_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble; The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high; <a id="c20_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Send thee help from the sanctuary, And strengthen thee out of Zion; <a id="c20_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Remember all thy offerings, And accept thy burnt-sacrifice;</p>

<p><a id="c20_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Grant thee thy heartâ€™s desire, And fulfil all thy counsel. <a id="c20_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> We will triumph in thy salvation, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners: Jehovah fulfil all thy petitions. <a id="c20_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Now know I that Jehovah saveth his anointed; He will answer him from his holy heaven With the saving strength of his right hand. <a id="c20_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will make mention of the name of Jehovah our God. <a id="c20_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> They are bowed down and fallen; But we are risen, and stand upright. <a id="c20_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Save, Jehovah: Let the King answer us when we call.</p>
