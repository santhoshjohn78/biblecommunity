<h2>Psalms 52</h2>

<p><a id="c52_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of God endureth continually. <a id="c52_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thy tongue deviseth very wickedness, Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. <a id="c52_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thou lovest evil more than good, And lying rather than to speak righteousness.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thou lovest all devouring words, thou deceitful tongue. <a id="c52_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> God will likewise destroy thee for ever; He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, And root thee out of the land of the living.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The righteous also shall see it, and fear, And shall laugh at him, saying, <a id="c52_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And strengthened himself in his wickedness. <a id="c52_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But as for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: I trust in the lovingkindness of God for ever and ever. <a id="c52_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I will give thee thanks for ever, because thou hast done it; And I will hope in thy name, for it is good, in the presence of thy saints.</p>
