<h2>Psalms 127</h2>

<p><a id="c127_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Except Jehovah build the house, They labor in vain that build it: Except Jehovah keep the city, The watchman waketh but in vain. <a id="c127_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> It is vain for you to rise up early, To take rest late, To eat the bread of toil; For so he giveth unto his beloved sleep. <a id="c127_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Lo, children are a heritage of Jehovah; And the fruit of the womb is his reward. <a id="c127_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of youth. <a id="c127_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: They shall not be put to shame, When they speak with their enemies in the gate.</p>
