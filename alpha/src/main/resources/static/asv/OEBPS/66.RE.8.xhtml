<h2>Revelation 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And when he opened the seventh seal, there followed a silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And I saw the seven angels that stand before God; and there were given unto them seven trumpets. <a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angelâ€™s hand. <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the angel taketh the censer; and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there followed thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake. <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and there died the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, even they that had life; and the third part of the ships was destroyed. <a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters; <a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. <a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner. <a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, for them that dwell on the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who are yet to sound.</p>
