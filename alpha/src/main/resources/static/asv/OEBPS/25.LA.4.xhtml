<h2>Lamentations 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> How is the gold become dim! how is the most pure gold changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: The daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: The young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: They that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid upon her. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: Their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> They that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger; For these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Jehovah hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger; And he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof. <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The kings of the earth believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> It is because of the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood, So that men cannot touch their garments. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Depart ye, they cried unto them, Unclean! depart, depart, touch not! When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn here. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The anger of Jehovah hath scattered them; he will no more regard them: They respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders. <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Our eyes do yet fail in looking for our vain help: In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save. <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> They hunt our steps, so that we cannot go in our streets: Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. <a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens: They chased us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. <a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits; Of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz: The cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. <a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will uncover thy sins.</p>
