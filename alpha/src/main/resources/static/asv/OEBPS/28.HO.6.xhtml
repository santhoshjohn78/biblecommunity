<h2>Hosea 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Come, and let us return unto Jehovah; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him. <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And let us know, let us follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth. <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth early away. <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth. <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For I desire goodness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings. <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me. <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity; it is stained with blood. <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they have committed lewdness. <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: there whoredom is found in Ephraim, Israel is defiled. <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee, when I bring back the captivity of my people.</p>
