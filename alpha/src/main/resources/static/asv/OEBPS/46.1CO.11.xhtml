<h2>1 Corinthians 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ. <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you. <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head. <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven. <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled. <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. <a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man: <a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man: <a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for this cause ought the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels. <a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord. <a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God. <a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled? <a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him? <a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. <a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. <a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse. <a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it. <a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you. <a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s supper: <a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> for in your eating each one taketh before other his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken. <a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not. <a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread; <a id="c11_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. <a id="c11_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink <a id="c11_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come. <a id="c11_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. <a id="c11_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. <a id="c11_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body. <a id="c11_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep. <a id="c11_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged. <a id="c11_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. <a id="c11_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another. <a id="c11_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.</p>
