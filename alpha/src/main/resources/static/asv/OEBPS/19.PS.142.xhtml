<h2>Psalms 142</h2>

<p><a id="c142_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I cry with my voice unto Jehovah; With my voice unto Jehovah do I make supplication. <a id="c142_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I pour out my complaint before him; I show before him my trouble. <a id="c142_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walk Have they hidden a snare for me. <a id="c142_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Look on my right hand, and see; For there is no man that knoweth me: Refuge hath failed me; No man careth for my soul. <a id="c142_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I cried unto thee, O Jehovah; I said, Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living. <a id="c142_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Attend unto my cry; For I am brought very low: Deliver me from my persecutors; For they are stronger than I. <a id="c142_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Bring my soul out of prison, That I may give thanks unto thy name: The righteous shall compass me about; For thou wilt deal bountifully with me.</p>
