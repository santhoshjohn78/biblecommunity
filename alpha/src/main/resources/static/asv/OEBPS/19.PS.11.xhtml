<h2>Psalms 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In Jehovah do I take refuge: How say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain; <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For, lo, the wicked bend the bow, They make ready their arrow upon the string, That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart; <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If the foundations be destroyed, What can the righteous do? <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Jehovah is in his holy temple; Jehovah, his throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Jehovah trieth the righteous; But the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Upon the wicked he will rain snares; Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup. <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For Jehovah is righteous; he loveth righteousness: The upright shall behold his face.</p>
