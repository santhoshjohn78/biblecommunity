<h2>Psalms 75</h2>

<p><a id="c75_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> We give thanks unto thee, O God; We give thanks, for thy name is near: Men tell of thy wondrous works. <a id="c75_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly. <a id="c75_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it.</p>

<p><a id="c75_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly; And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: <a id="c75_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Lift not up your horn on high; Speak not with a stiff neck. <a id="c75_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor yet from the south, cometh lifting up. <a id="c75_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and lifteth up another. <a id="c75_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foameth; It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them. <a id="c75_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. <a id="c75_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.</p>
