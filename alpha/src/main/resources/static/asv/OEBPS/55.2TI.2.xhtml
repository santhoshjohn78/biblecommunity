<h2>2 Timothy 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of this life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowned, except he have contended lawfully. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The husbandmen that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel: <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him: <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us: <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth. <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness, <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: of whom is Hymenaeus an Philetus; <a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some. <a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness. <a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor. <a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master’s use, prepared unto every good work. <a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. <a id="c2_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes. <a id="c2_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And the Lord’s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing, <a id="c2_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth, <a id="c2_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.</p>
