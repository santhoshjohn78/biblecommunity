<h2>Proverbs 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A soft answer turneth away wrath; But a grievous word stirreth up anger. <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The tongue of the wise uttereth knowledge aright; But the mouth of fools poureth out folly. <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The eyes of Jehovah are in every place, Keeping watch upon the evil and the good. <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> A gentle tongue is a tree of life; But perverseness therein is a breaking of the spirit. <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> A fool despiseth his fatherâ€™s correction; But he that regardeth reproof getteth prudence. <a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> In the house of the righteous is much treasure; But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. <a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The lips of the wise disperse knowledge; But the heart of the foolish doeth not so. <a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah; But the prayer of the upright is his delight. <a id="c15_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The way of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah; But he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. <a id="c15_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> There is grievous correction for him that forsaketh the way; And he that hateth reproof shall die. <a id="c15_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Sheol and Abaddon are before Jehovah: How much more then the hearts of the children of men! <a id="c15_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> A scoffer loveth not to be reproved; He will not go unto the wise. <a id="c15_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> A glad heart maketh a cheerful countenance; But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken. <a id="c15_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge; But the mouth of fools feedeth on folly. <a id="c15_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> All the days of the afflicted are evil; But he that is of a cheerful heart hath a continual feast. <a id="c15_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Better is little, with the fear of Jehovah, Than great treasure and trouble therewith. <a id="c15_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. <a id="c15_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> A wrathful man stirreth up contention; But he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife. <a id="c15_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The way of the sluggard is as a hedge of thorns; But the path of the upright is made a highway. <a id="c15_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> A wise son maketh a glad father; But a foolish man despiseth his mother. <a id="c15_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Folly is joy to him that is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding maketh straight his going. <a id="c15_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Where there is no counsel, purposes are disappointed; But in the multitude of counsellors they are established. <a id="c15_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> A man hath joy in the answer of his mouth; And a word in due season, how good is it! <a id="c15_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> To the wise the way of life goeth upward, That he may depart from Sheol beneath. <a id="c15_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Jehovah will root up the house of the proud; But he will establish the border of the widow. <a id="c15_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Evil devices are an abomination to Jehovah; But pleasant words are pure. <a id="c15_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; But he that hateth bribes shall live. <a id="c15_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> The heart of the righteous studieth to answer; But the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things. <a id="c15_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Jehovah is far from the wicked; But he heareth the prayer of the righteous. <a id="c15_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart; And good tidings make the bones fat. <a id="c15_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> The ear that hearkeneth to the reproof of life Shall abide among the wise. <a id="c15_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> He that refuseth correction despiseth his own soul; But he that hearkeneth to reproof getteth understanding. <a id="c15_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> The fear of Jehovah is the instruction of wisdom; And before honor goeth humility.</p>
