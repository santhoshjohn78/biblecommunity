<h2>Philippians 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions, <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> make full my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind; <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> doing nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself; <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped, <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name; <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Do all things without murmurings and questionings: <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world, <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain. <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all: <a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me. <a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. <a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state. <a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ. <a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child serveth a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the gospel. <a id="c2_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me: <a id="c2_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly. <a id="c2_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need; <a id="c2_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick: <a id="c2_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow. <a id="c2_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. <a id="c2_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor: <a id="c2_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.</p>
