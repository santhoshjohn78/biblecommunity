<h2>1 Timothy 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons, <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron; <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving: <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> If thou put the brethren in mind of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed until now: <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> but refuse profane and old wivesâ€™ fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness: <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> These things command and teach. <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Be diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Take heed to thyself, and to thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee.</p>
