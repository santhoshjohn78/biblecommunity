Praise, O ye servants of Jehovah, Praise the name of Jehovah. <a id="c113_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Blessed be the name of Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore. <a id="c113_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same Jehovahâ€™s name is to be praised. <a id="c113_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Jehovah is high above all nations, And his glory above the heavens. <a id="c113_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Who is like unto Jehovah our God, That hath his seat on high, <a id="c113_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> That humbleth himself to behold The things that are in heaven and in the earth? <a id="c113_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, And lifteth up the needy from the dunghill; <a id="c113_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> That he may set him with princes, Even with the princes of his people. <a id="c113_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He maketh the barren woman to keep house, And to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye Jehovah.</p>
