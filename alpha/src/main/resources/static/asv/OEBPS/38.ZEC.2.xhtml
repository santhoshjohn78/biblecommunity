<h2>Zechariah 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand. <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof. <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For I, saith Jehovah, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, saith Jehovah; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, saith Jehovah. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Ho Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: After glory hath he sent me unto the nations which plundered you; for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Jehovah. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me unto thee. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Jehovah shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.</p>
