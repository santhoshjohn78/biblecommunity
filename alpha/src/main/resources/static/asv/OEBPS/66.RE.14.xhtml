<h2>Revelation 14</h2>

<p><a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads. <a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and the voice which I heard <a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and they sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, even they that had been purchased out of the earth. <a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> These are they that were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, to be the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb. <a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish. <a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people; <a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters. <a id="c14_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. <a id="c14_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand, <a id="c14_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: <a id="c14_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name. <a id="c14_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. <a id="c14_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And I heard the voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them. <a id="c14_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud I saw one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand sharp sickle. <a id="c14_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. <a id="c14_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped. <a id="c14_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. <a id="c14_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. <a id="c14_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great <a id="c14_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And the winepress are trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</p>
