<h2>Psalms 130</h2>

<p><a id="c130_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Jehovah. <a id="c130_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Lord, hear my voice: Let thine ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications. <a id="c130_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If thou, Jehovah, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? <a id="c130_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> But there is forgiveness with thee, That thou mayest be feared. <a id="c130_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I wait for Jehovah, my soul doth wait, And in his word do I hope. <a id="c130_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> My soul waiteth for the Lord More than watchmen wait for the morning; Yea, more than watchmen for the morning. <a id="c130_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> O Israel, hope in Jehovah; For with Jehovah there is lovingkindness, And with him is plenteous redemption. <a id="c130_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he will redeem Israel From all his iniquities.</p>
