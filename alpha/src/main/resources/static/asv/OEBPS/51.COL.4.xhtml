<h2>Colossians 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Masters, render unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Continue stedfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving; <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> withal praying for us also, that God may open unto us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds; <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer each one. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> All my affairs shall Tychicus make known unto you, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord: <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> whom I have sent you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts; <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things that are done here. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner saluteth you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (touching whom ye received commandments; if he come unto you, receive him), <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and Jesus that is called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these only are my fellow-workers unto the kingdom of God, men that have been a comfort unto me. <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, saluteth you, always striving for you in his prayers, that ye may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For I bear him witness, that he hath much labor for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas salute you. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Salute the brethren that are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church that is in their house. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And when this epistle hath been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye also read the epistle from Laodicea. <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it. <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you.</p>
