<h2>Judges 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. <a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son of Jehovah. <a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I verily dedicate the silver unto Jehovah from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee. <a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah. <a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. <a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there. <a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find a place, and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. <a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place. <a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten pieces of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in. <a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. <a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. <a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Then said Micah, Now know I that Jehovah will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.</p>
