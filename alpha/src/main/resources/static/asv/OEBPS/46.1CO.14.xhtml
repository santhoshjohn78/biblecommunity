<h2>1 Corinthians 14</h2>

<p><a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy. <a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth; but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. <a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and exhortation, and consolation. <a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church. <a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying. <a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching? <a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? <a id="c14_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war? <a id="c14_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking into the air. <a id="c14_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no kind is without signification. <a id="c14_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me. <a id="c14_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church. <a id="c14_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret. <a id="c14_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. <a id="c14_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. <a id="c14_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Else if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest? <a id="c14_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. <a id="c14_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all: <a id="c14_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue. <a id="c14_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Brethren, be not children in mind: yet in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men. <a id="c14_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith the Lord. <a id="c14_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe. <a id="c14_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> If therefore the whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad? <a id="c14_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all; <a id="c14_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed. <a id="c14_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. <a id="c14_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> If any man speaketh in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most three, and that in turn; and let one interpret: <a id="c14_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. <a id="c14_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And let the prophets speak by two or three, and let the others discern. <a id="c14_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence. <a id="c14_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> For ye all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted; <a id="c14_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets; <a id="c14_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints, <a id="c14_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law. <a id="c14_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church. <a id="c14_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you alone? <a id="c14_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write unto you, that they are the commandment of the Lord. <a id="c14_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant. <a id="c14_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues. <a id="c14_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> But let all things be done decently and in order.</p>
