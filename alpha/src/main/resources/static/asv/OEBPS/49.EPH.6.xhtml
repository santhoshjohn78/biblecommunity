<h2>Ephesians 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Honor thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise), <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord. <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Servants, be obedient unto them that according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> not in the way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> with good will doing service, as unto the Lord, and not unto men: <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> knowing that whatsoever good thing each one doeth, the same shall he receive again from the Lord, whether he be bond or free. <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, and forbear threatening: knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him. <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might. <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Wherefore take up the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand. <a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, <a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; <a id="c6_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> withal taking up the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one. <a id="c6_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: <a id="c6_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereunto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints, <a id="c6_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And on my behalf, that utterance may be given unto me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, <a id="c6_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. <a id="c6_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> But that ye also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: <a id="c6_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts. <a id="c6_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <a id="c6_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ with a love incorruptible.</p>
