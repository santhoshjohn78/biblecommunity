<h2>Psalms 82</h2>

<p><a id="c82_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> God standeth in the congregation of God; He judgeth among the gods. <a id="c82_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> How long will ye judge unjustly, And respect the persons of the wicked?</p>

<p><a id="c82_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Judge the poor and fatherless: Do justice to the afflicted and destitute. <a id="c82_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Rescue the poor and needy: Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked. <a id="c82_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They know not, neither do they understand; They walk to and fro in darkness: All the foundations of the earth are shaken. <a id="c82_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I said, Ye are gods, And all of you sons of the Most High. <a id="c82_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Nevertheless ye shall die like men, And fall like one of the princes. <a id="c82_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Arise, O God, judge the earth; For thou shalt inherit all the nations.</p>
