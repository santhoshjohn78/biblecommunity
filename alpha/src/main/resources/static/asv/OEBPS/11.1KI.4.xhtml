<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And king Solomon was king over all Israel. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And these were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest; <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder; <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, and the king’s friend; <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to taskwork.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And these are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill-country of Ephraim; <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Ben-deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan; <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him pertained Socoh, and all the land of Hepher); <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Ben-abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife); <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam; <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; even to him pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars); <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife); <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth; <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar; <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin; <a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer that was in the land.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry. <a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life. <a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, <a id="c4_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl. <a id="c4_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> For he had dominion over all the region on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides round about him. <a id="c4_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon. <a id="c4_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. <a id="c4_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking. <a id="c4_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore. <a id="c4_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. <a id="c4_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations round about. <a id="c4_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And he spake three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five. <a id="c4_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spake also of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fishes. <a id="c4_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.</p>
