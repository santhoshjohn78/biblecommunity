<h2>Psalms 133</h2>

<p><a id="c133_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brethren to dwell together in unity! <a id="c133_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> It is like the precious oil upon the head, That ran down upon the beard, Even Aaronâ€™s beard; That came down upon the skirt of his garments; <a id="c133_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Like the dew of Hermon, That cometh down upon the mountains of Zion: For there Jehovah commanded the blessing, Even life for evermore.</p>
