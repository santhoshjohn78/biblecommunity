<h2>Ecclesiastes 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and, behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Wherefore I praised the dead that have been long dead more than the living that are yet alive; <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> yea, better than them both did I esteem him that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then I saw all labor and every skilful work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, saith he, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone? <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
