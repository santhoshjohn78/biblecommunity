to the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for the house of God to set it up in its place: <a id="c2_v69"></a><span class="vn">69</span> they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work threescore and one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests’ garments. <a id="c2_v70"></a><span class="vn">70</span> So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.</p>
