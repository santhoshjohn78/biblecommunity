<h2>Ezekiel 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest? <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned: is it profitable for any work? <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work! <a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set my face against them. <a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p>
