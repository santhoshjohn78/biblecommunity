<h2>Psalms 126</h2>

<a id="c126_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Song of degrees.</b> When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. <a id="c126_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them. <a id="c126_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The LORD hath done great things for us; <em>whereof</em> we are glad. <a id="c126_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south. <a id="c126_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. <a id="c126_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves <em>with him</em>.
