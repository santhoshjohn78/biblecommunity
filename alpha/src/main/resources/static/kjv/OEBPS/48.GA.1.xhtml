<h2>Galatians 1</h2>

<a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Grace <em>be</em> to you and peace from God the Father, and <em>from</em> our Lord Jesus Christ, <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> To whom <em>be</em> glory for ever and ever. Amen. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> As we said before, so say I now again, If any <em>man</em> preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught <em>it</em>, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called <em>me</em> by his grace, <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. <a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother. <a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. <a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; <a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: <a id="c1_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. <a id="c1_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And they glorified God in me.
