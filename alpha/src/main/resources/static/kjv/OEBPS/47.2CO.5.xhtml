<h2>2 Corinthians 5</h2>

<a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For we know that if our earthly house of <em>this</em> tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For we that are in <em>this</em> tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing <em>is</em> God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Therefore <em>we are</em> always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> (For we walk by faith, not by sight:) <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> We are confident, <em>I say</em>, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things <em>done</em> in <em>his</em> body, according to that he hath done, whether <em>it be</em> good or bad. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to <em>answer</em> them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For whether we be beside ourselves, <em>it is</em> to God: or whether we be sober, <em>it is</em> for your cause. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And <em>that</em> he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we <em>him</em> no more. <a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Therefore if any man <em>be</em> in Christ, <em>he is</em> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. <a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And all things <em>are</em> of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech <em>you</em> by us: we pray <em>you</em> in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. <a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For he hath made him <em>to be</em> sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
