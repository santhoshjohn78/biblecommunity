<h2>1 Samuel 27</h2>

<a id="c27_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: <em>there is</em> nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand. <a id="c27_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that <em>were</em> with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath. <a id="c27_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, <em>even</em> David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife. <a id="c27_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him. <a id="c27_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee? <a id="c27_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day. <a id="c27_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months. <a id="c27_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those <em>nations were</em> of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt. <a id="c27_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish. <a id="c27_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites. <a id="c27_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring <em>tidings</em> to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so <em>will be</em> his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines. <a id="c27_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
