<h2>Psalms 87</h2>

<a id="c87_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Psalm <em>or</em> Song for the sons of Korah.</b> His foundation <em>is</em> in the holy mountains. <a id="c87_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. <a id="c87_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. <a id="c87_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this <em>man</em> was born there. <a id="c87_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her. <a id="c87_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, <em>that</em> this <em>man</em> was born there. Selah. <a id="c87_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> As well the singers as the players on instruments <em>shall be there</em>: all my springs <em>are</em> in thee.
