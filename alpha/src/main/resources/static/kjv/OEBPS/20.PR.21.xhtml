<h2>Proverbs 21</h2>

<a id="c21_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The king's heart <em>is</em> in the hand of the LORD, <em>as</em> the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will. <a id="c21_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Every way of a man <em>is</em> right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts. <a id="c21_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> To do justice and judgment <em>is</em> more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. <a id="c21_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> An high look, and a proud heart, <em>and</em> the plowing of the wicked, <em>is</em> sin. <a id="c21_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The thoughts of the diligent <em>tend</em> only to plenteousness; but of every one <em>that is</em> hasty only to want. <a id="c21_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The getting of treasures by a lying tongue <em>is</em> a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death. <a id="c21_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment. <a id="c21_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The way of man <em>is</em> froward and strange: but <em>as for</em> the pure, his work <em>is</em> right. <a id="c21_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> <em>It is</em> better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house. <a id="c21_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes. <a id="c21_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. <a id="c21_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The righteous <em>man</em> wisely considereth the house of the wicked: <em>but God</em> overthroweth the wicked for <em>their</em> wickedness. <a id="c21_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard. <a id="c21_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath. <a id="c21_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> <em>It is</em> joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction <em>shall be</em> to the workers of iniquity. <a id="c21_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead. <a id="c21_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He that loveth pleasure <em>shall be</em> a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. <a id="c21_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The wicked <em>shall be</em> a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright. <a id="c21_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> <em>It is</em> better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman. <a id="c21_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> <em>There is</em> treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up. <a id="c21_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour. <a id="c21_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> A wise <em>man</em> scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof. <a id="c21_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles. <a id="c21_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Proud <em>and</em> haughty scorner <em>is</em> his name, who dealeth in proud wrath. <a id="c21_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour. <a id="c21_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not. <a id="c21_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The sacrifice of the wicked <em>is</em> abomination: how much more, <em>when</em> he bringeth it with a wicked mind? <a id="c21_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly. <a id="c21_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> A wicked man hardeneth his face: but <em>as for</em> the upright, he directeth his way. <a id="c21_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> <em>There is</em> no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD. <a id="c21_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> The horse <em>is</em> prepared against the day of battle: but safety <em>is</em> of the LORD.
