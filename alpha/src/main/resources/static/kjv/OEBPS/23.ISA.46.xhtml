<h2>Isaiah 46</h2>

<a id="c46_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages <em>were</em> heavy loaden; <em>they are</em> a burden to the weary <em>beast</em>. <a id="c46_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity. <a id="c46_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne <em>by me</em> from the belly, which are carried from the womb: <a id="c46_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And <em>even</em> to <em>your</em> old age I <em>am</em> he; and <em>even</em> to hoar hairs will I carry <em>you</em>: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver <em>you</em>. <a id="c46_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> To whom will ye liken me, and make <em>me</em> equal, and compare me, that we may be like? <a id="c46_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, <em>and</em> hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship. <a id="c46_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, <em>one</em> shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble. <a id="c46_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring <em>it</em> again to mind, O ye transgressors. <a id="c46_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Remember the former things of old: for I <em>am</em> God, and <em>there is</em> none else; <em>I am</em> God, and <em>there is</em> none like me, <a id="c46_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times <em>the things</em> that are not <em>yet</em> done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure: <a id="c46_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken <em>it</em>, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed <em>it</em>, I will also do it. <a id="c46_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that <em>are</em> far from righteousness: <a id="c46_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.
