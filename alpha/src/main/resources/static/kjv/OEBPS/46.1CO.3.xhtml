<h2>1 Corinthians 3</h2>

<a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, <em>even</em> as unto babes in Christ. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able <em>to bear it</em>, neither yet now are ye able. <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For ye are yet carnal: for whereas <em>there is</em> among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I <em>am</em> of Apollos; are ye not carnal? <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Who then is Paul, and who <em>is</em> Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, <em>ye are</em> God's building. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and <em>that</em> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which <em>temple</em> ye are. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; <a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; <a id="c3_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And ye are Christ's; and Christ <em>is</em> God's.
