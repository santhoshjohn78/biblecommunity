<h2>Psalms 26</h2>

<a id="c26_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b><em>A Psalm</em> of David.</b> Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; <em>therefore</em> I shall not slide. <a id="c26_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. <a id="c26_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For thy lovingkindness <em>is</em> before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. <a id="c26_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. <a id="c26_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked. <a id="c26_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD: <a id="c26_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. <a id="c26_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. <a id="c26_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: <a id="c26_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> In whose hands <em>is</em> mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. <a id="c26_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me. <a id="c26_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
