<h2>Leviticus 13</h2>

<a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, <a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh <em>like</em> the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests: <a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and <em>when</em> the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight <em>be</em> deeper than the skin of his flesh, it <em>is</em> a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean. <a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> If the bright spot <em>be</em> white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight <em>be</em> not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up <em>him that hath</em> the plague seven days: <a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, <em>if</em> the plague in his sight be at a stay, <em>and</em> the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more: <a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, <em>if</em> the plague <em>be</em> somewhat dark, <em>and</em> the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it <em>is but</em> a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. <a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again: <a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And <em>if</em> the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <em>is</em> a leprosy. <a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest; <a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the priest shall see <em>him</em>: and, behold, <em>if</em> the rising <em>be</em> white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and <em>there be</em> quick raw flesh in the rising; <a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> It <em>is</em> an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he <em>is</em> unclean. <a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of <em>him that hath</em> the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; <a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, <em>if</em> the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce <em>him</em> clean <em>that hath</em> the plague: it is all turned white: he <em>is</em> clean. <a id="c13_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean. <a id="c13_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: <em>for</em> the raw flesh <em>is</em> unclean: it <em>is</em> a leprosy. <a id="c13_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest; <a id="c13_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the priest shall see him: and, behold, <em>if</em> the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce <em>him</em> clean <em>that hath</em> the plague: he <em>is</em> clean. <a id="c13_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The flesh also, in which, <em>even</em> in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed, <a id="c13_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest; <a id="c13_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it <em>be</em> in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <em>is</em> a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil. <a id="c13_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> But if the priest look on it, and, behold, <em>there be</em> no white hairs therein, and <em>if</em> it <em>be</em> not lower than the skin, but <em>be</em> somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: <a id="c13_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <em>is</em> a plague. <a id="c13_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> But if the bright spot stay in his place, <em>and</em> spread not, it <em>is</em> a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. <a id="c13_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Or if there be <em>any</em> flesh, in the skin whereof <em>there is</em> a hot burning, and the quick <em>flesh</em> that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white; <a id="c13_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, <em>if</em> the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it <em>be in</em> sight deeper than the skin; it <em>is</em> a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <em>is</em> the plague of leprosy. <a id="c13_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> But if the priest look on it, and, behold, <em>there be</em> no white hair in the bright spot, and it <em>be</em> no lower than the <em>other</em> skin, but <em>be</em> somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: <a id="c13_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: <em>and</em> if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <em>is</em> the plague of leprosy. <a id="c13_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And if the bright spot stay in his place, <em>and</em> spread not in the skin, but it <em>be</em> somewhat dark; it <em>is</em> a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it <em>is</em> an inflammation of the burning. <a id="c13_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard; <a id="c13_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it <em>be</em> in sight deeper than the skin; <em>and there be</em> in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <em>is</em> a dry scall, <em>even</em> a leprosy upon the head or beard. <a id="c13_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it <em>be</em> not in sight deeper than the skin, and <em>that there is</em> no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up <em>him that hath</em> the plague of the scall seven days: <a id="c13_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, <em>if</em> the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall <em>be</em> not in sight deeper than the skin; <a id="c13_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up <em>him that hath</em> the scall seven days more: <a id="c13_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, <em>if</em> the scall be not spread in the skin, nor <em>be</em> in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. <a id="c13_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing; <a id="c13_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he <em>is</em> unclean. <a id="c13_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and <em>that</em> there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he <em>is</em> clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean. <a id="c13_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, <em>even</em> white bright spots; <a id="c13_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> Then the priest shall look: and, behold, <em>if</em> the bright spots in the skin of their flesh <em>be</em> darkish white; it <em>is</em> a freckled spot <em>that</em> groweth in the skin; he <em>is</em> clean. <a id="c13_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he <em>is</em> bald; <em>yet is</em> he clean. <a id="c13_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he <em>is</em> forehead bald: <em>yet is</em> he clean. <a id="c13_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it <em>is</em> a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead. <a id="c13_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, <em>if</em> the rising of the sore <em>be</em> white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh; <a id="c13_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> He is a leprous man, he <em>is</em> unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague <em>is</em> in his head. <a id="c13_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> And the leper in whom the plague <em>is</em>, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean. <a id="c13_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> All the days wherein the plague <em>shall be</em> in him he shall be defiled; he <em>is</em> unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp <em>shall</em> his habitation <em>be</em>. <a id="c13_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, <em>whether it be</em> a woollen garment, or a linen garment; <a id="c13_v48"></a><span class="vn">48</span> Whether <em>it be</em> in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin; <a id="c13_v49"></a><span class="vn">49</span> And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it <em>is</em> a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest: <a id="c13_v50"></a><span class="vn">50</span> And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up <em>it that hath</em> the plague seven days: <a id="c13_v51"></a><span class="vn">51</span> And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, <em>or</em> in any work that is made of skin; the plague <em>is</em> a fretting leprosy; it <em>is</em> unclean. <a id="c13_v52"></a><span class="vn">52</span> He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it <em>is</em> a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire. <a id="c13_v53"></a><span class="vn">53</span> And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; <a id="c13_v54"></a><span class="vn">54</span> Then the priest shall command that they wash <em>the thing</em> wherein the plague <em>is</em>, and he shall shut it up seven days more: <a id="c13_v55"></a><span class="vn">55</span> And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, <em>if</em> the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it <em>is</em> unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it <em>is</em> fret inward, <em>whether</em> it <em>be</em> bare within or without. <a id="c13_v56"></a><span class="vn">56</span> And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague <em>be</em> somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: <a id="c13_v57"></a><span class="vn">57</span> And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it <em>is</em> a spreading <em>plague</em>: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague <em>is</em> with fire. <a id="c13_v58"></a><span class="vn">58</span> And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin <em>it be</em>, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean. <a id="c13_v59"></a><span class="vn">59</span> This <em>is</em> the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
