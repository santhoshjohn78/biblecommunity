<h2>Psalms 150</h2>

<a id="c150_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. <a id="c150_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness. <a id="c150_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp. <a id="c150_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs. <a id="c150_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. <a id="c150_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.
