<h2>1 Corinthians 11</h2>

<a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Be ye followers of me, even as I also <em>am</em> of Christ. <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered <em>them</em> to you. <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman <em>is</em> the man; and the head of Christ <em>is</em> God. <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Every man praying or prophesying, having <em>his</em> head covered, dishonoureth his head. <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with <em>her</em> head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For a man indeed ought not to cover <em>his</em> head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. <a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. <a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. <a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For this cause ought the woman to have power on <em>her</em> head because of the angels. <a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. <a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For as the woman <em>is</em> of the man, even so <em>is</em> the man also by the woman; but all things of God. <a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? <a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? <a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for <em>her</em> hair is given her for a covering. <a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. <a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Now in this that I declare <em>unto you</em> I praise <em>you</em> not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse. <a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. <a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. <a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> When ye come together therefore into one place, <em>this</em> is not to eat the Lord's supper. <a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For in eating every one taketh before <em>other</em> his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken. <a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise <em>you</em> not. <a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the <em>same</em> night in which he was betrayed took bread: <a id="c11_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And when he had given thanks, he brake <em>it</em>, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. <a id="c11_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> After the same manner also <em>he took</em> the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink <em>it</em>, in remembrance of me. <a id="c11_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. <a id="c11_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink <em>this</em> cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. <a id="c11_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of <em>that</em> bread, and drink of <em>that</em> cup. <a id="c11_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. <a id="c11_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> For this cause many <em>are</em> weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. <a id="c11_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. <a id="c11_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. <a id="c11_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. <a id="c11_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
