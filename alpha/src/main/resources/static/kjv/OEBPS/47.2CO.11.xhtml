<h2>2 Corinthians 11</h2>

<a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Would to God ye could bear with me a little in <em>my</em> folly: and indeed bear with me. <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present <em>you as</em> a chaste virgin to Christ. <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or <em>if</em> ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with <em>him</em>. <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> But though <em>I be</em> rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things. <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? <a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I robbed other churches, taking wages <em>of them</em>, to do you service. <a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all <em>things</em> I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and <em>so</em> will I keep <em>myself</em>. <a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. <a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. <a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. <a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For such <em>are</em> false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. <a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. <a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Therefore <em>it is</em> no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. <a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. <a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> That which I speak, I speak <em>it</em> not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. <a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. <a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye <em>yourselves</em> are wise. <a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour <em>you</em>, if a man take <em>of you</em>, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. <a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. <a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Are they Hebrews? so <em>am</em> I. Are they Israelites? so <em>am</em> I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so <em>am</em> I. <a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I <em>am</em> more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. <a id="c11_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Of the Jews five times received I forty <em>stripes</em> save one. <a id="c11_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; <a id="c11_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> <em>In</em> journeyings often, <em>in</em> perils of waters, <em>in</em> perils of robbers, <em>in</em> perils by <em>mine own</em> countrymen, <em>in</em> perils by the heathen, <em>in</em> perils in the city, <em>in</em> perils in the wilderness, <em>in</em> perils in the sea, <em>in</em> perils among false brethren; <a id="c11_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. <a id="c11_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. <a id="c11_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? <a id="c11_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. <a id="c11_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. <a id="c11_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: <a id="c11_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
