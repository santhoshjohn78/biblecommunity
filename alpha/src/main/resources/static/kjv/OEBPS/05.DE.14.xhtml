<h2>Deuteronomy 14</h2>

<a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Ye <em>are</em> the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead. <a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For thou <em>art</em> an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations that <em>are</em> upon the earth. <a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing. <a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> These <em>are</em> the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat, <a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois. <a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, <em>and</em> cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat. <a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; <em>as</em> the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; <em>therefore</em> they <em>are</em> unclean unto you. <a id="c14_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it <em>is</em> unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase. <a id="c14_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> These ye shall eat of all that <em>are</em> in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat: <a id="c14_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it <em>is</em> unclean unto you. <a id="c14_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> <em>Of</em> all clean birds ye shall eat. <a id="c14_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But these <em>are they</em> of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, <a id="c14_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind, <a id="c14_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And every raven after his kind, <a id="c14_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, <a id="c14_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, <a id="c14_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant, <a id="c14_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. <a id="c14_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And every creeping thing that flieth <em>is</em> unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten. <a id="c14_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> <em>But of</em> all clean fowls ye may eat. <a id="c14_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Ye shall not eat <em>of</em> any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger that <em>is</em> in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou <em>art</em> an holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. <a id="c14_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year. <a id="c14_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always. <a id="c14_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; <em>or</em> if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee: <a id="c14_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Then shalt thou turn <em>it</em> into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: <a id="c14_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household, <a id="c14_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And the Levite that <em>is</em> within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee. <a id="c14_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay <em>it</em> up within thy gates: <a id="c14_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which <em>are</em> within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.
