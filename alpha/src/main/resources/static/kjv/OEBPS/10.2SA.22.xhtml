<h2>2 Samuel 22</h2>

<a id="c22_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day <em>that</em> the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: <a id="c22_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he said, The LORD <em>is</em> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; <a id="c22_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The God of my rock; in him will I trust: <em>he is</em> my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence. <a id="c22_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I will call on the LORD, <em>who is</em> worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. <a id="c22_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid; <a id="c22_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me; <a id="c22_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry <em>did enter</em> into his ears. <a id="c22_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth. <a id="c22_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. <a id="c22_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness <em>was</em> under his feet. <a id="c22_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind. <a id="c22_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, <em>and</em> thick clouds of the skies. <a id="c22_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled. <a id="c22_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice. <a id="c22_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them. <a id="c22_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils. <a id="c22_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters; <a id="c22_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> He delivered me from my strong enemy, <em>and</em> from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me. <a id="c22_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. <a id="c22_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me. <a id="c22_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. <a id="c22_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. <a id="c22_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> For all his judgments <em>were</em> before me: and <em>as for</em> his statutes, I did not depart from them. <a id="c22_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity. <a id="c22_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight. <a id="c22_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, <em>and</em> with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright. <a id="c22_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury. <a id="c22_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes <em>are</em> upon the haughty, <em>that</em> thou mayest bring <em>them</em> down. <a id="c22_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> For thou <em>art</em> my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness. <a id="c22_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall. <a id="c22_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> <em>As for</em> God, his way <em>is</em> perfect; the word of the LORD <em>is</em> tried: he <em>is</em> a buckler to all them that trust in him. <a id="c22_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> For who <em>is</em> God, save the LORD? and who <em>is</em> a rock, save our God? <a id="c22_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> God <em>is</em> my strength <em>and</em> power: and he maketh my way perfect. <a id="c22_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> He maketh my feet like hinds' <em>feet</em>: and setteth me upon my high places. <a id="c22_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. <a id="c22_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great. <a id="c22_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip. <a id="c22_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them. <a id="c22_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet. <a id="c22_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me. <a id="c22_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me. <a id="c22_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> They looked, but <em>there was</em> none to save; <em>even</em> unto the LORD, but he answered them not. <a id="c22_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, <em>and</em> did spread them abroad. <a id="c22_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me <em>to be</em> head of the heathen: a people <em>which</em> I knew not shall serve me. <a id="c22_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me. <a id="c22_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places. <a id="c22_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> The LORD liveth; and blessed <em>be</em> my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation. <a id="c22_v48"></a><span class="vn">48</span> It <em>is</em> God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me, <a id="c22_v49"></a><span class="vn">49</span> And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. <a id="c22_v50"></a><span class="vn">50</span> Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name. <a id="c22_v51"></a><span class="vn">51</span> <em>He is</em> the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.
