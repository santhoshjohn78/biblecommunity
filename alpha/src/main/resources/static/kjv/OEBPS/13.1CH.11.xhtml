<h2>1 Chronicles 11</h2>

<a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we <em>are</em> thy bone and thy flesh. <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou <em>wast</em> he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel. <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel. <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which <em>is</em> Jebus; where the Jebusites <em>were</em>, the inhabitants of the land. <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which <em>is</em> the city of David. <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief. <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David. <a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city. <a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts <em>was</em> with him. <a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> These also <em>are</em> the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, <em>and</em> with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel. <a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And this <em>is</em> the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain <em>by him</em> at one time. <a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And after him <em>was</em> Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who <em>was one</em> of the three mighties. <a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. <a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And they set themselves in the midst of <em>that</em> parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved <em>them</em> by a great deliverance. <a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim. <a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And David <em>was</em> then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison <em>was</em> then at Bethlehem. <a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that <em>is</em> at the gate! <a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that <em>was</em> by the gate, and took <em>it</em>, and brought <em>it</em> to David: but David would not drink <em>of</em> it, but poured it out to the LORD, <a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with <em>the jeopardy of</em> their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest. <a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew <em>them</em>, and had a name among the three. <a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the <em>first</em> three. <a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day. <a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And he slew an Egyptian, a man of <em>great</em> stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand <em>was</em> a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. <a id="c11_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> These <em>things</em> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties. <a id="c11_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the <em>first</em> three: and David set him over his guard. <a id="c11_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Also the valiant men of the armies <em>were</em>, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, <a id="c11_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, <a id="c11_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite, <a id="c11_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, <a id="c11_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, <a id="c11_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, <em>that pertained</em> to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, <a id="c11_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, <a id="c11_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, <a id="c11_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite, <a id="c11_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, <a id="c11_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, <a id="c11_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, <a id="c11_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri, <a id="c11_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, <a id="c11_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, <a id="c11_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, <a id="c11_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him, <a id="c11_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, <a id="c11_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite, <a id="c11_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite, <a id="c11_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite, <a id="c11_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.
