<h2>Isaiah 12</h2>

<a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Behold, God <em>is</em> my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH <em>is</em> my strength and <em>my</em> song; he also is become my salvation. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this <em>is</em> known in all the earth. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great <em>is</em> the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
