<h2>1 Corinthians 13</h2>

<a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become <em>as</em> sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. <a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And though I have <em>the gift of</em> prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. <a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And though I bestow all my goods to feed <em>the poor</em>, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. <a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Charity suffereth long, <em>and</em> is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, <a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; <a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; <a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. <a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Charity never faileth: but whether <em>there be</em> prophecies, they shall fail; whether <em>there be</em> tongues, they shall cease; whether <em>there be</em> knowledge, it shall vanish away. <a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. <a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. <a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. <a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. <a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these <em>is</em> charity.
