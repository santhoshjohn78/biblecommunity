<h2>1 Samuel 23</h2>

<a id="c23_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors. <a id="c23_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah. <a id="c23_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines? <a id="c23_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand. <a id="c23_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. <a id="c23_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, <em>that</em> he came down <em>with</em> an ephod in his hand. <a id="c23_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars. <a id="c23_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. <a id="c23_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod. <a id="c23_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. <a id="c23_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down. <a id="c23_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver <em>thee</em> up. <a id="c23_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Then David and his men, <em>which were</em> about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth. <a id="c23_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand. <a id="c23_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David <em>was</em> in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood. <a id="c23_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God. <a id="c23_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth. <a id="c23_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house. <a id="c23_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which <em>is</em> on the south of Jeshimon? <a id="c23_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part <em>shall be</em> to deliver him into the king's hand. <a id="c23_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Saul said, Blessed <em>be</em> ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me. <a id="c23_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, <em>and</em> who hath seen him there: for it is told me <em>that</em> he dealeth very subtilly. <a id="c23_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah. <a id="c23_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men <em>were</em> in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon. <a id="c23_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Saul also and his men went to seek <em>him</em>. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard <em>that</em>, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon. <a id="c23_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them. <a id="c23_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land. <a id="c23_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth. <a id="c23_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.
