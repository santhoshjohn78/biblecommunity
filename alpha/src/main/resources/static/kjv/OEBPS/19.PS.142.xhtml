<h2>Psalms 142</h2>

<a id="c142_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave.</b> I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication. <a id="c142_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. <a id="c142_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. <a id="c142_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I looked on <em>my</em> right hand, and beheld, but <em>there was</em> no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. <a id="c142_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou <em>art</em> my refuge <em>and</em> my portion in the land of the living. <a id="c142_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. <a id="c142_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
