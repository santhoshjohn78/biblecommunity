<h2>2 Corinthians 2</h2>

<a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness. <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is <em>the joy</em> of you all. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Sufficient to such a man <em>is</em> this punishment, which <em>was inflicted</em> of many. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> So that contrariwise ye <em>ought</em> rather to forgive <em>him</em>, and comfort <em>him</em>, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm <em>your</em> love toward him. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> To whom ye forgive any thing, I <em>forgive</em> also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave <em>it</em>, for your sakes <em>forgave I it</em> in the person of Christ; <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Furthermore, when I came to Troas to <em>preach</em> Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Now thanks <em>be</em> unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> To the one <em>we are</em> the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who <em>is</em> sufficient for these things? <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
