<h2>Ecclesiastes 10</h2>

<a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: <em>so doth</em> a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom <em>and</em> honour. <a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> A wise man's heart <em>is</em> at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left. <a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth <em>him</em>, and he saith to every one <em>that</em> he <em>is</em> a fool. <a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences. <a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> There is an evil <em>which</em> I have seen under the sun, as an error <em>which</em> proceedeth from the ruler: <a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. <a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. <a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him. <a id="c10_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; <em>and</em> he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby. <a id="c10_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom <em>is</em> profitable to direct. <a id="c10_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better. <a id="c10_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The words of a wise man's mouth <em>are</em> gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. <a id="c10_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The beginning of the words of his mouth <em>is</em> foolishness: and the end of his talk <em>is</em> mischievous madness. <a id="c10_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him? <a id="c10_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city. <a id="c10_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Woe to thee, O land, when thy king <em>is</em> a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! <a id="c10_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Blessed <em>art</em> thou, O land, when thy king <em>is</em> the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! <a id="c10_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through. <a id="c10_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all <em>things</em>. <a id="c10_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
