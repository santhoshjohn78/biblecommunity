<h2>Psalms 24</h2>

<a id="c24_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Psalm of David.</b> The earth <em>is</em> the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. <a id="c24_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. <a id="c24_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place? <a id="c24_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. <a id="c24_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. <a id="c24_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> This <em>is</em> the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah. <a id="c24_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. <a id="c24_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Who <em>is</em> this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle. <a id="c24_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift <em>them</em> up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. <a id="c24_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he <em>is</em> the King of glory. Selah.
