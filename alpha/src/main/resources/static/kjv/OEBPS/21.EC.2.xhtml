<h2>Ecclesiastes 2</h2>

<a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also <em>is</em> vanity. <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I said of laughter, <em>It is</em> mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what <em>was</em> that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all <em>kind of</em> fruits: <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I got <em>me</em> servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me: <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, <em>as</em> musical instruments, and that of all sorts. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all <em>was</em> vanity and vexation of spirit, and <em>there was</em> no profit under the sun. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what <em>can</em> the man <em>do</em> that cometh after the king? <em>even</em> that which hath been already done. <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The wise man's eyes <em>are</em> in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also <em>is</em> vanity. <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> For <em>there is</em> no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now <em>is</em> in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise <em>man</em>? as the fool. <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun <em>is</em> grievous unto me: for all <em>is</em> vanity and vexation of spirit. <a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me. <a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise <em>man</em> or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This <em>is</em> also vanity. <a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun. <a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For there is a man whose labour <em>is</em> in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it <em>for</em> his portion. This also <em>is</em> vanity and a great evil. <a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? <a id="c2_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> For all his days <em>are</em> sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity. <a id="c2_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> <em>There is</em> nothing better for a man, <em>than</em> that he should eat and drink, and <em>that</em> he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it <em>was</em> from the hand of God. <a id="c2_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> For who can eat, or who else can hasten <em>hereunto</em>, more than I? <a id="c2_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For <em>God</em> giveth to a man that <em>is</em> good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to <em>him that is</em> good before God. This also <em>is</em> vanity and vexation of spirit.
