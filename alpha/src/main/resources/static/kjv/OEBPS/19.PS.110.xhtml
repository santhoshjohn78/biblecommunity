<h2>Psalms 110</h2>

<a id="c110_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Psalm of David.</b> The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. <a id="c110_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. <a id="c110_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thy people <em>shall be</em> willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth. <a id="c110_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou <em>art</em> a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. <a id="c110_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. <a id="c110_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill <em>the places</em> with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries. <a id="c110_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
