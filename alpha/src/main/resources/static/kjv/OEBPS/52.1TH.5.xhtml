<h2>1 Thessalonians 5</h2>

<a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Therefore let us not sleep, as <em>do</em> others; but let us watch and be sober. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. <em>And</em> be at peace among yourselves. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all <em>men</em>. <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> See that none render evil for evil unto any <em>man</em>; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all <em>men</em>. <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Rejoice evermore. <a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Pray without ceasing. <a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Quench not the Spirit. <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Despise not prophesyings. <a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. <a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Abstain from all appearance of evil. <a id="c5_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and <em>I pray God</em> your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. <a id="c5_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Faithful <em>is</em> he that calleth you, who also will do <em>it</em>. <a id="c5_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Brethren, pray for us. <a id="c5_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. <a id="c5_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren. <a id="c5_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <em>be</em> with you. Amen.<blue> The first <em>epistle</em> to the Thessalonians was written from Athens.</blue>
