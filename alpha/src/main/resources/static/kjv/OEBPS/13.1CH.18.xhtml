<h2>1 Chronicles 18</h2>

<a id="c18_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines. <a id="c18_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, <em>and</em> brought gifts. <a id="c18_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates. <a id="c18_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot <em>horses</em>, but reserved of them an hundred chariots. <a id="c18_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. <a id="c18_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Then David put <em>garrisons</em> in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, <em>and</em> brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. <a id="c18_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. <a id="c18_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. <a id="c18_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; <a id="c18_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and <em>with him</em> all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. <a id="c18_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all <em>these</em> nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. <a id="c18_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand. <a id="c18_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. <a id="c18_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people. <a id="c18_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Joab the son of Zeruiah <em>was</em> over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder. <a id="c18_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, <em>were</em> the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; <a id="c18_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <em>was</em> over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David <em>were</em> chief about the king.
