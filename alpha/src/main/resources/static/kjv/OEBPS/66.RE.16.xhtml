<h2>Revelation 16</h2>

<a id="c16_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth. <a id="c16_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and <em>upon</em> them which worshipped his image. <a id="c16_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead <em>man</em>: and every living soul died in the sea. <a id="c16_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood. <a id="c16_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus. <a id="c16_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy. <a id="c16_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous <em>are</em> thy judgments. <a id="c16_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire. <a id="c16_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory. <a id="c16_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, <a id="c16_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds. <a id="c16_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared. <a id="c16_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs <em>come</em> out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. <a id="c16_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, <em>which</em> go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. <a id="c16_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed <em>is</em> he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. <a id="c16_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon. <a id="c16_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. <a id="c16_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, <em>and</em> so great. <a id="c16_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. <a id="c16_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. <a id="c16_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, <em>every stone</em> about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.
