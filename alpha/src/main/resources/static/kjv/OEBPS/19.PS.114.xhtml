<h2>Psalms 114</h2>

<a id="c114_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; <a id="c114_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Judah was his sanctuary, <em>and</em> Israel his dominion. <a id="c114_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The sea saw <em>it</em>, and fled: Jordan was driven back. <a id="c114_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The mountains skipped like rams, <em>and</em> the little hills like lambs. <a id="c114_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> What <em>ailed</em> thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, <em>that</em> thou wast driven back? <a id="c114_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Ye mountains, <em>that</em> ye skipped like rams; <em>and</em> ye little hills, like lambs? <a id="c114_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; <a id="c114_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Which turned the rock <em>into</em> a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
