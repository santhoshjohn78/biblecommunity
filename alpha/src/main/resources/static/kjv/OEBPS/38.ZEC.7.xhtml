<h2>Zechariah 7</h2>

<a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, <em>that</em> the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth <em>day</em> of the ninth month, <em>even</em> in Chisleu; <a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD, <a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> <em>And</em> to speak unto the priests which <em>were</em> in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years? <a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying, <a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh <em>month</em>, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, <em>even</em> to me? <a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat <em>for yourselves</em>, and drink <em>for yourselves</em>? <a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> <em>Should ye</em> not <em>hear</em> the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when <em>men</em> inhabited the south and the plain? <a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying, <a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother: <a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. <a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear. <a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Yea, they made their hearts <em>as</em> an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts. <a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Therefore it is come to pass, <em>that</em> as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts: <a id="c7_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.
