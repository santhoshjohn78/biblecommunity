<h2>Psalms 112</h2>

<a id="c112_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Blessed <em>is</em> the man <em>that</em> feareth the LORD, <em>that</em> delighteth greatly in his commandments. <a id="c112_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. <a id="c112_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Wealth and riches <em>shall be</em> in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever. <a id="c112_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: <em>he is</em> gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. <a id="c112_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion. <a id="c112_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. <a id="c112_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD. <a id="c112_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> His heart <em>is</em> established, he shall not be afraid, until he see <em>his desire</em> upon his enemies. <a id="c112_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour. <a id="c112_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The wicked shall see <em>it</em>, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
