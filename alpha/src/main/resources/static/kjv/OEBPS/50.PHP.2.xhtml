<h2>Philippians 2</h2>

<a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> If <em>there be</em> therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, <em>being</em> of one accord, of one mind. <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> <em>Let</em> nothing <em>be done</em> through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of <em>things</em> in heaven, and <em>things</em> in earth, and <em>things</em> under the earth; <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And <em>that</em> every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ <em>is</em> Lord, to the glory of God the Father. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of <em>his</em> good pleasure. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Do all things without murmurings and disputings: <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. <a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. <a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. <a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. <a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. <a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel. <a id="c2_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. <a id="c2_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. <a id="c2_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. <a id="c2_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. <a id="c2_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. <a id="c2_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. <a id="c2_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: <a id="c2_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
