<h2>Galatians 5</h2>

<a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> This persuasion <em>cometh</em> not of him that calleth you. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> I would they were even cut off which trouble you. <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only <em>use</em> not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For all the law is fulfilled in one word, <em>even</em> in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> <em>This</em> I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. <a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. <a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are <em>these</em>; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, <a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told <em>you</em> in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. <a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, <a id="c5_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. <a id="c5_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. <a id="c5_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. <a id="c5_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
