<h2>Proverbs 28</h2>

<a id="c28_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion. <a id="c28_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For the transgression of a land many <em>are</em> the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding <em>and</em> knowledge the state <em>thereof</em> shall be prolonged. <a id="c28_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> A poor man that oppresseth the poor <em>is like</em> a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. <a id="c28_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them. <a id="c28_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all <em>things</em>. <a id="c28_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Better <em>is</em> the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than <em>he that is</em> perverse <em>in his</em> ways, though he <em>be</em> rich. <a id="c28_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Whoso keepeth the law <em>is</em> a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous <em>men</em> shameth his father. <a id="c28_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. <a id="c28_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer <em>shall be</em> abomination. <a id="c28_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good <em>things</em> in possession. <a id="c28_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The rich man <em>is</em> wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. <a id="c28_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> When righteous <em>men</em> do rejoice, <em>there is</em> great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. <a id="c28_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh <em>them</em> shall have mercy. <a id="c28_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Happy <em>is</em> the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. <a id="c28_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> <em>As</em> a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; <em>so is</em> a wicked ruler over the poor people. <a id="c28_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The prince that wanteth understanding <em>is</em> also a great oppressor: <em>but</em> he that hateth covetousness shall prolong <em>his</em> days. <a id="c28_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> A man that doeth violence to the blood of <em>any</em> person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him. <a id="c28_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but <em>he that is</em> perverse <em>in his</em> ways shall fall at once. <a id="c28_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain <em>persons</em> shall have poverty enough. <a id="c28_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. <a id="c28_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> To have respect of persons <em>is</em> not good: for for a piece of bread <em>that</em> man will transgress. <a id="c28_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> He that hasteth to be rich <em>hath</em> an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him. <a id="c28_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue. <a id="c28_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, <em>It is</em> no transgression; the same <em>is</em> the companion of a destroyer. <a id="c28_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat. <a id="c28_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. <a id="c28_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. <a id="c28_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
