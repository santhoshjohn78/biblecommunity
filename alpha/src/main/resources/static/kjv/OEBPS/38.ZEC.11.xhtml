<h2>Zechariah 11</h2>

<a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down. <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> <em>There is</em> a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled. <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed <em>be</em> the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not. <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver <em>them</em>. <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I will feed the flock of slaughter, <em>even</em> you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. <a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me. <a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another. <a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And I took my staff, <em>even</em> Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people. <a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it <em>was</em> the word of the LORD. <a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I said unto them, If ye think good, give <em>me</em> my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty <em>pieces</em> of silver. <a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty <em>pieces</em> of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD. <a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Then I cut asunder mine other staff, <em>even</em> Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. <a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd. <a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, <em>which</em> shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces. <a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword <em>shall be</em> upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
