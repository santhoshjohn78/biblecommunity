<h2>2 Corinthians 8</h2>

<a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. <a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For to <em>their</em> power, I bear record, yea, and beyond <em>their</em> power <em>they were</em> willing of themselves; <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and <em>take upon us</em> the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And <em>this they did</em>, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Therefore, as ye abound in every <em>thing, in</em> faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and <em>in</em> all diligence, and <em>in</em> your love to us, <em>see</em> that ye abound in this grace also. <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. <a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And herein I give <em>my</em> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. <a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Now therefore perform the doing <em>of it</em>; that as <em>there was</em> a readiness to will, so <em>there may be</em> a performance also out of that which ye have. <a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For if there be first a willing mind, <em>it is</em> accepted according to that a man hath, <em>and</em> not according to that he hath not. <a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For <em>I mean</em> not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: <a id="c8_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But by an equality, <em>that</em> now at this time your abundance <em>may be a supply</em> for their want, that their abundance also may be <em>a supply</em> for your want: that there may be equality: <a id="c8_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> As it is written, He that <em>had gathered</em> much had nothing over; and he that <em>had gathered</em> little had no lack. <a id="c8_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> But thanks <em>be</em> to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you. <a id="c8_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you. <a id="c8_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise <em>is</em> in the gospel throughout all the churches; <a id="c8_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And not <em>that</em> only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and <em>declaration of</em> your ready mind: <a id="c8_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: <a id="c8_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. <a id="c8_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which <em>I have</em> in you. <a id="c8_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Whether <em>any do enquire</em> of Titus, <em>he is</em> my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren <em>be enquired of, they are</em> the messengers of the churches, <em>and</em> the glory of Christ. <a id="c8_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
