<h2>Ecclesiastes 1</h2>

<a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all <em>is</em> vanity. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> <em>One</em> generation passeth away, and <em>another</em> generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits. <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea <em>is</em> not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> All things <em>are</em> full of labour; man cannot utter <em>it</em>: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The thing that hath been, it <em>is that</em> which shall be; and that which is done <em>is</em> that which shall be done: and <em>there is</em> no new <em>thing</em> under the sun. <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Is there <em>any</em> thing whereof it may be said, See, this <em>is</em> new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> <em>There is</em> no remembrance of former <em>things</em>; neither shall there be <em>any</em> remembrance of <em>things</em> that are to come with <em>those</em> that shall come after. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all <em>things</em> that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all <em>is</em> vanity and vexation of spirit. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> <em>That which is</em> crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all <em>they</em> that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For in much wisdom <em>is</em> much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
