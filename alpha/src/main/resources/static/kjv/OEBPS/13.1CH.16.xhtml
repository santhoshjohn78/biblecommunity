<h2>1 Chronicles 16</h2>

<a id="c16_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. <a id="c16_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. <a id="c16_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon <em>of wine</em>. <a id="c16_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he appointed <em>certain</em> of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel: <a id="c16_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; <a id="c16_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. <a id="c16_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Then on that day David delivered first <em>this psalm</em> to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. <a id="c16_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people. <a id="c16_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works. <a id="c16_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. <a id="c16_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually. <a id="c16_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; <a id="c16_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. <a id="c16_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> He <em>is</em> the LORD our God; his judgments <em>are</em> in all the earth. <a id="c16_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word <em>which</em> he commanded to a thousand generations; <a id="c16_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> <em>Even of the covenant</em> which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; <a id="c16_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, <em>and</em> to Israel <em>for</em> an everlasting covenant, <a id="c16_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; <a id="c16_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it. <a id="c16_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And <em>when</em> they went from nation to nation, and from <em>one</em> kingdom to another people; <a id="c16_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, <a id="c16_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> <em>Saying</em>, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. <a id="c16_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation. <a id="c16_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations. <a id="c16_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> For great <em>is</em> the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also <em>is</em> to be feared above all gods. <a id="c16_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For all the gods of the people <em>are</em> idols: but the LORD made the heavens. <a id="c16_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Glory and honour <em>are</em> in his presence; strength and gladness <em>are</em> in his place. <a id="c16_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. <a id="c16_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Give unto the LORD the glory <em>due</em> unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. <a id="c16_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved. <a id="c16_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let <em>men</em> say among the nations, The LORD reigneth. <a id="c16_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that <em>is</em> therein. <a id="c16_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth. <a id="c16_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> O give thanks unto the LORD; for <em>he is</em> good; for his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever. <a id="c16_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, <em>and</em> glory in thy praise. <a id="c16_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Blessed <em>be</em> the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD. <a id="c16_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required: <a id="c16_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah <em>to be</em> porters: <a id="c16_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that <em>was</em> at Gibeon, <a id="c16_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and <em>to do</em> according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel; <a id="c16_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy <em>endureth</em> for ever; <a id="c16_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun <em>were</em> porters. <a id="c16_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
