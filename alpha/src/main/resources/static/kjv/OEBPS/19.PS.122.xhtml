<h2>Psalms 122</h2>

<a id="c122_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Song of degrees of David.</b> I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD. <a id="c122_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. <a id="c122_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: <a id="c122_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. <a id="c122_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. <a id="c122_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. <a id="c122_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Peace be within thy walls, <em>and</em> prosperity within thy palaces. <a id="c122_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace <em>be</em> within thee. <a id="c122_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
