<h2>Psalms 149</h2>

<a id="c149_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, <em>and</em> his praise in the congregation of saints. <a id="c149_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. <a id="c149_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. <a id="c149_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation. <a id="c149_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. <a id="c149_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> <em>Let</em> the high <em>praises</em> of God <em>be</em> in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand; <a id="c149_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> To execute vengeance upon the heathen, <em>and</em> punishments upon the people; <a id="c149_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; <a id="c149_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.
