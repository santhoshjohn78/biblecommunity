<h2>2 Corinthians 3</h2>

<a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some <em>others</em>, epistles of commendation to you, or <em>letters</em> of commendation from you? <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> <em>Forasmuch as ye are</em> manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency <em>is</em> of God; <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But if the ministration of death, written <em>and</em> engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which <em>glory</em> was to be done away: <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For if the ministration of condemnation <em>be</em> glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For if that which is done away <em>was</em> glorious, much more that which remaineth <em>is</em> glorious. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And not as Moses, <em>which</em> put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which <em>vail</em> is done away in Christ. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord <em>is</em>, there <em>is</em> liberty. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, <em>even</em> as by the Spirit of the Lord.
