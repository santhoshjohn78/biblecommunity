<h2>1 Samuel 16</h2>

<a id="c16_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons. <a id="c16_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear <em>it</em>, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD. <a id="c16_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me <em>him</em> whom I name unto thee. <a id="c16_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? <a id="c16_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. <a id="c16_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed <em>is</em> before him. <a id="c16_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for <em>the LORD seeth</em> not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart. <a id="c16_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. <a id="c16_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. <a id="c16_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these. <a id="c16_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all <em>thy</em> children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither. <a id="c16_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And he sent, and brought him in. Now he <em>was</em> ruddy, <em>and</em> withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this <em>is</em> he. <a id="c16_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. <a id="c16_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him. <a id="c16_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee. <a id="c16_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Let our lord now command thy servants, <em>which are</em> before thee, to seek out a man, <em>who is</em> a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well. <a id="c16_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring <em>him</em> to me. <a id="c16_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, <em>that is</em> cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD <em>is</em> with him. <a id="c16_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which <em>is</em> with the sheep. <a id="c16_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Jesse took an ass <em>laden</em> with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent <em>them</em> by David his son unto Saul. <a id="c16_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer. <a id="c16_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight. <a id="c16_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And it came to pass, when the <em>evil</em> spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
