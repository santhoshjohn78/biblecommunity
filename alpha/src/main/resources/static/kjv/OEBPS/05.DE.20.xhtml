<h2>Deuteronomy 20</h2>

<a id="c20_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, <em>and</em> a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God <em>is</em> with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. <a id="c20_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people, <a id="c20_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them; <a id="c20_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For the LORD your God <em>is</em> he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you. <a id="c20_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man <em>is there</em> that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. <a id="c20_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And what man <em>is he</em> that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not <em>yet</em> eaten of it? let him <em>also</em> go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it. <a id="c20_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And what man <em>is there</em> that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her. <a id="c20_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man <em>is there that is</em> fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart. <a id="c20_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people. <a id="c20_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it. <a id="c20_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, <em>that</em> all the people <em>that is</em> found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee. <a id="c20_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it: <a id="c20_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: <a id="c20_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, <em>even</em> all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee. <a id="c20_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities <em>which are</em> very far off from thee, which <em>are</em> not of the cities of these nations. <a id="c20_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee <em>for</em> an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth: <a id="c20_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> But thou shalt utterly destroy them; <em>namely</em>, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee: <a id="c20_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God. <a id="c20_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field <em>is</em> man's <em>life</em>) to employ <em>them</em> in the siege: <a id="c20_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Only the trees which thou knowest that they <em>be</em> not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.
