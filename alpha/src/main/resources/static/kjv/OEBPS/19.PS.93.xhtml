<h2>Psalms 93</h2>

<a id="c93_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, <em>wherewith</em> he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. <a id="c93_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thy throne <em>is</em> established of old: thou <em>art</em> from everlasting. <a id="c93_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. <a id="c93_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The LORD on high <em>is</em> mightier than the noise of many waters, <em>yea, than</em> the mighty waves of the sea. <a id="c93_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.
