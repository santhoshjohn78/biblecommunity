<h2>Hosea 3</h2>

<a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of <em>her</em> friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> So I bought her to me for fifteen <em>pieces</em> of silver, and <em>for</em> an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for <em>another</em> man: so <em>will</em> I also <em>be</em> for thee. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and <em>without</em> teraphim: <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.
