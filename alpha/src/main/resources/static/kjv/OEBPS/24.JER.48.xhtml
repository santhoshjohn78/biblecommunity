<h2>Jeremiah 48</h2>

<a id="c48_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded <em>and</em> taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed. <a id="c48_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> <em>There shall be</em> no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from <em>being</em> a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee. <a id="c48_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> A voice of crying <em>shall be</em> from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction. <a id="c48_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard. <a id="c48_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction. <a id="c48_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness. <a id="c48_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity <em>with</em> his priests and his princes together. <a id="c48_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken. <a id="c48_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein. <a id="c48_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Cursed <em>be</em> he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed <em>be</em> he that keepeth back his sword from blood. <a id="c48_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed. <a id="c48_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles. <a id="c48_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence. <a id="c48_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> How say ye, We <em>are</em> mighty and strong men for the war? <a id="c48_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Moab is spoiled, and gone up <em>out of</em> her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name <em>is</em> the LORD of hosts. <a id="c48_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The calamity of Moab <em>is</em> near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast. <a id="c48_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, <em>and</em> the beautiful rod! <a id="c48_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from <em>thy</em> glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, <em>and</em> he shall destroy thy strong holds. <a id="c48_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, <em>and</em> say, What is done? <a id="c48_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled, <a id="c48_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath, <a id="c48_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim, <a id="c48_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon, <a id="c48_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near. <a id="c48_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD. <a id="c48_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Make ye him drunken: for he magnified <em>himself</em> against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision. <a id="c48_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy. <a id="c48_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove <em>that</em> maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth. <a id="c48_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart. <a id="c48_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but <em>it shall</em> not <em>be</em> so; his lies shall not so effect <em>it</em>. <a id="c48_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; <em>mine heart</em> shall mourn for the men of Kirheres. <a id="c48_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach <em>even</em> to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage. <a id="c48_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; <em>their</em> shouting <em>shall be</em> no shouting. <a id="c48_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> From the cry of Heshbon <em>even</em> unto Elealeh, <em>and even</em> unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar <em>even</em> unto Horonaim, <em>as</em> an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate. <a id="c48_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods. <a id="c48_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches <em>that</em> he hath gotten are perished. <a id="c48_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> For every head <em>shall be</em> bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands <em>shall be</em> cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth. <a id="c48_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> <em>There shall be</em> lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein <em>is</em> no pleasure, saith the LORD. <a id="c48_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> They shall howl, <em>saying</em>, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him. <a id="c48_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab. <a id="c48_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. <a id="c48_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> And Moab shall be destroyed from <em>being</em> a people, because he hath magnified <em>himself</em> against the LORD. <a id="c48_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> Fear, and the pit, and the snare, <em>shall be</em> upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD. <a id="c48_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, <em>even</em> upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD. <a id="c48_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones. <a id="c48_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives. <a id="c48_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far <em>is</em> the judgment of Moab.
