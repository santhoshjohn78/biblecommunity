<h2>Jeremiah 15</h2>

<a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, <em>yet</em> my mind <em>could</em> not <em>be</em> toward this people: cast <em>them</em> out of my sight, and let them go forth. <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as <em>are</em> for death, to death; and such as <em>are</em> for the sword, to the sword; and such as <em>are</em> for the famine, to the famine; and such as <em>are</em> for the captivity, to the captivity. <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy. <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for <em>that</em> which he did in Jerusalem. <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest? <a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting. <a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave <em>them</em> of children, I will destroy my people, <em>since</em> they return not from their ways. <a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused <em>him</em> to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city. <a id="c15_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while <em>it was</em> yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD. <a id="c15_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; <em>yet</em> every one of them doth curse me. <a id="c15_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee <em>well</em> in the time of evil and in the time of affliction. <a id="c15_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel? <a id="c15_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and <em>that</em> for all thy sins, even in all thy borders. <a id="c15_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And I will make <em>thee</em> to pass with thine enemies into a land <em>which</em> thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, <em>which</em> shall burn upon you. <a id="c15_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke. <a id="c15_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts. <a id="c15_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation. <a id="c15_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, <em>which</em> refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, <em>and as</em> waters <em>that</em> fail? <a id="c15_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, <em>and</em> thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them. <a id="c15_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I <em>am</em> with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD. <a id="c15_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.
