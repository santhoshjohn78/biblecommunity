<h2>Ecclesiastes 11</h2>

<a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If the clouds be full of rain, they empty <em>themselves</em> upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be. <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> As thou knowest not what <em>is</em> the way of the spirit, <em>nor</em> how the bones <em>do grow</em> in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all. <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both <em>shall be</em> alike good. <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Truly the light <em>is</em> sweet, and a pleasant <em>thing it is</em> for the eyes to behold the sun: <a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But if a man live many years, <em>and</em> rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh <em>is</em> vanity. <a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these <em>things</em> God will bring thee into judgment. <a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth <em>are</em> vanity.
