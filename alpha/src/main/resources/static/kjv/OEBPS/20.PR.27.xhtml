<h2>Proverbs 27</h2>

<a id="c27_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. <a id="c27_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. <a id="c27_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> A stone<em> is</em> heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath<em> is</em> heavier than them both. <a id="c27_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Wrath<em> is</em> cruel, and anger<em> is</em> outrageous; but who<em> is</em> able to stand before envy? <a id="c27_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Open rebuke<em> is</em> better than secret love. <a id="c27_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Faithful<em> are</em> the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy<em> are</em> deceitful. <a id="c27_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. <a id="c27_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so<em> is</em> a man that wandereth from his place. <a id="c27_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so<em> doth</em> the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel. <a id="c27_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity:<em> for</em> better<em> is</em> a neighbour<em> that is</em> near than a brother far off. <a id="c27_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me. <a id="c27_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> A prudent<em> man</em> foreseeth the evil,<em> and</em> hideth himself;<em> but</em> the simple pass on,<em> and</em> are punished. <a id="c27_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. <a id="c27_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. <a id="c27_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. <a id="c27_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, <em>which</em> bewrayeth <em>itself</em>. <a id="c27_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. <a id="c27_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured. <a id="c27_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> As in water face <em>answereth</em> to face, so the heart of man to man. <a id="c27_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. <a id="c27_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> <em>As</em> the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so <em>is</em> a man to his praise. <a id="c27_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, <em>yet</em> will not his foolishness depart from him. <a id="c27_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, <em>and</em> look well to thy herds. <a id="c27_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> For riches <em>are</em> not for ever: and doth the crown <em>endure</em> to every generation? <a id="c27_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered. <a id="c27_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> The lambs <em>are</em> for thy clothing, and the goats <em>are</em> the price of the field. <a id="c27_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And <em>thou shalt have</em> goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and <em>for</em> the maintenance for thy maidens.
