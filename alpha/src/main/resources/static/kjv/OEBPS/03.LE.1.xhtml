<h2>Leviticus 1</h2>

<a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, <em>even</em> of the herd, and of the flock. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If his offering <em>be</em> a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD. <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that <em>is by</em> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces. <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire: <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that <em>is</em> on the fire which <em>is</em> upon the altar: <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, <em>to be</em> a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And if his offering <em>be</em> of the flocks, <em>namely</em>, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish. <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that <em>is</em> on the fire which <em>is</em> upon the altar: <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring <em>it</em> all, and burn <em>it</em> upon the altar: it <em>is</em> a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD <em>be</em> of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn <em>it</em> on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar: <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes: <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, <em>but</em> shall not divide <em>it</em> asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that <em>is</em> upon the fire: it <em>is</em> a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
