<h2>Lamentations 2</h2>

<a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, <em>and</em> cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger! <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought <em>them</em> down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof. <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He hath cut off in <em>his</em> fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, <em>which</em> devoureth round about. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all <em>that were</em> pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as <em>if it were of</em> a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes <em>are</em> among the Gentiles: the law <em>is</em> no <em>more</em>; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, <em>and</em> keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> They say to their mothers, Where <em>is</em> corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom. <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach <em>is</em> great like the sea: who can heal thee? <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> All that pass by clap <em>their</em> hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, <em>saying, Is</em> this the city that <em>men</em> call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth? <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed <em>her</em> up: certainly this <em>is</em> the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen <em>it</em>. <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The LORD hath done <em>that</em> which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused <em>thine</em> enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries. <a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease. <a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street. <a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, <em>and</em> children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord? <a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain <em>them</em> in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, <em>and</em> not pitied. <a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD'S anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.
