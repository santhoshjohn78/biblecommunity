<h2>Proverbs 29</h2>

<a id="c29_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> He, that being often reproved hardeneth <em>his</em> neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. <a id="c29_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. <a id="c29_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth <em>his</em> substance. <a id="c29_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it. <a id="c29_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet. <a id="c29_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> In the transgression of an evil man <em>there is</em> a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. <a id="c29_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: <em>but</em> the wicked regardeth not to know <em>it</em>. <a id="c29_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise <em>men</em> turn away wrath. <a id="c29_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> <em>If</em> a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, <em>there is</em> no rest. <a id="c29_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul. <a id="c29_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise <em>man</em> keepeth it in till afterwards. <a id="c29_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants <em>are</em> wicked. <a id="c29_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes. <a id="c29_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever. <a id="c29_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left <em>to himself</em> bringeth his mother to shame. <a id="c29_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall. <a id="c29_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul. <a id="c29_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Where <em>there is</em> no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy <em>is</em> he. <a id="c29_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer. <a id="c29_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Seest thou a man <em>that is</em> hasty in his words? <em>there is</em> more hope of a fool than of him. <a id="c29_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become <em>his</em> son at the length. <a id="c29_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression. <a id="c29_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit. <a id="c29_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth <em>it</em> not. <a id="c29_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe. <a id="c29_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Many seek the ruler's favour; but <em>every</em> man's judgment <em>cometh</em> from the LORD. <a id="c29_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> An unjust man <em>is</em> an abomination to the just: and <em>he that is</em> upright in the way <em>is</em> abomination to the wicked.
