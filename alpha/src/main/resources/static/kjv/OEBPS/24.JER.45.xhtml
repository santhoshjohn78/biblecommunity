<h2>Jeremiah 45</h2>

<a id="c45_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, <a id="c45_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch; <a id="c45_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest. <a id="c45_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, <em>that</em> which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land. <a id="c45_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek <em>them</em> not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.
