<h2>Ecclesiastes 3</h2>

<a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To every <em>thing there is</em> a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up <em>that which is</em> planted; <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> He hath made every <em>thing</em> beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> I know that <em>there is</em> no good in them, but for <em>a man</em> to rejoice, and to do good in his life. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it <em>is</em> the gift of God. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth <em>it</em>, that <em>men</em> should fear before him. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, <em>that</em> wickedness <em>was</em> there; and the place of righteousness, <em>that</em> iniquity <em>was</em> there. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for <em>there is</em> a time there for every purpose and for every work. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all <em>is</em> vanity. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? <a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Wherefore I perceive that <em>there is</em> nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that <em>is</em> his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
