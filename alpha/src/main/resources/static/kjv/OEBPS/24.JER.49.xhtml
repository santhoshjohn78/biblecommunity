<h2>Jeremiah 49</h2>

<a id="c49_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why <em>then</em> doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities? <a id="c49_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD. <a id="c49_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, <em>and</em> his priests and his princes together. <a id="c49_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, <em>saying</em>, Who shall come unto me? <a id="c49_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth. <a id="c49_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD. <a id="c49_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; <em>Is</em> wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished? <a id="c49_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time <em>that</em> I will visit him. <a id="c49_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave <em>some</em> gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough. <a id="c49_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he <em>is</em> not. <a id="c49_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve <em>them</em> alive; and let thy widows trust in me. <a id="c49_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment <em>was</em> not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and <em>art</em> thou he <em>that</em> shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink <em>of it</em>. <a id="c49_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes. <a id="c49_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, <em>saying</em>, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle. <a id="c49_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, <em>and</em> despised among men. <a id="c49_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, <em>and</em> the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD. <a id="c49_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. <a id="c49_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour <em>cities</em> thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it. <a id="c49_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who <em>is</em> a chosen <em>man, that</em> I may appoint over her? for who <em>is</em> like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who <em>is</em> that shepherd that will stand before me? <a id="c49_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them. <a id="c49_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea. <a id="c49_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. <a id="c49_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; <em>there is</em> sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet. <a id="c49_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Damascus is waxed feeble, <em>and</em> turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on <em>her</em>: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail. <a id="c49_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy! <a id="c49_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts. <a id="c49_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad. <a id="c49_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east. <a id="c49_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear <em>is</em> on every side. <a id="c49_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. <a id="c49_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, <em>which</em> dwell alone. <a id="c49_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them <em>that are</em> in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD. <a id="c49_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, <em>and</em> a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor <em>any</em> son of man dwell in it. <a id="c49_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, <a id="c49_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might. <a id="c49_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. <a id="c49_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, <em>even</em> my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them: <a id="c49_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD. <a id="c49_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> But it shall come to pass in the latter days, <em>that</em> I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.
