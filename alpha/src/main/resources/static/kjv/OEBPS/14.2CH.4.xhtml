<a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And under it <em>was</em> the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen <em>were</em> cast, when it was cast. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea <em>was set</em> above upon them, and all their hinder parts <em>were</em> inward. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the thickness of it <em>was</em> an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; <em>and</em> it received and held three thousand baths. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea <em>was</em> for the priests to wash in. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set <em>them</em> in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He made also ten tables, and placed <em>them</em> in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God; <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> <em>To wit</em>, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters <em>which were</em> on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which <em>were</em> on the top of the pillars; <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which <em>were</em> upon the pillars. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> One sea, and twelve oxen under it. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass. <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah. <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out. <a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And Solomon made all the vessels that <em>were for</em> the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread <em>was set</em>; <a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold; <a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, <em>made he of</em> gold, <em>and</em> that perfect gold; <a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, <em>of</em> pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy <em>place</em>, and the doors of the house of the temple, <em>were of</em> gold.
