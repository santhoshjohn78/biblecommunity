<h2>Psalms 75</h2>

<a id="c75_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>To the chief Musician, Altaschith, A Psalm <em>or</em> Song of Asaph.</b> Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, <em>unto thee</em> do we give thanks: for <em>that</em> thy name is near thy wondrous works declare. <a id="c75_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly. <a id="c75_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah. <a id="c75_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: <a id="c75_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Lift not up your horn on high: speak <em>not with</em> a stiff neck. <a id="c75_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For promotion <em>cometh</em> neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. <a id="c75_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But God <em>is</em> the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another. <a id="c75_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For in the hand of the LORD <em>there is</em> a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring <em>them</em> out, <em>and</em> drink <em>them</em>. <a id="c75_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. <a id="c75_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; <em>but</em> the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
