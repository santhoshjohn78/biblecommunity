<h2>Mark 12</h2>

<a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And he began to speak unto them by parables. A <em>certain</em> man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about <em>it</em>, and digged <em>a place for</em> the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And they caught <em>him</em>, and beat him, and sent <em>him</em> away empty. <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded <em>him</em> in the head, and sent <em>him</em> away shamefully handled. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And they took him, and killed <em>him</em>, and cast <em>him</em> out of the vineyard. <a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. <a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner: <a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? <a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way. <a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in <em>his</em> words. <a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? <a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see <em>it</em>. <a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And they brought <em>it</em>. And he saith unto them, Whose <em>is</em> this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. <a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him. <a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying, <a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave <em>his</em> wife <em>behind him</em>, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. <a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. <a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise. <a id="c12_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also. <a id="c12_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. <a id="c12_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? <a id="c12_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. <a id="c12_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I <em>am</em> the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? <a id="c12_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err. <a id="c12_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all? <a id="c12_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments <em>is</em>, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: <a id="c12_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this <em>is</em> the first commandment. <a id="c12_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And the second <em>is</em> like, <em>namely</em> this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. <a id="c12_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: <a id="c12_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love <em>his</em> neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. <a id="c12_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him <em>any question</em>. <a id="c12_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David? <a id="c12_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool. <a id="c12_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he <em>then</em> his son? And the common people heard him gladly. <a id="c12_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and <em>love</em> salutations in the marketplaces, <a id="c12_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts: <a id="c12_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation. <a id="c12_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. <a id="c12_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. <a id="c12_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> And he called <em>unto him</em> his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: <a id="c12_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> For all <em>they</em> did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, <em>even</em> all her living.
