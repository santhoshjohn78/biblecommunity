<h2>Song of Solomon 5</h2>

<a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I am come into my garden, my sister, <em>my</em> spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I sleep, but my heart waketh: <em>it is</em> the voice of my beloved that knocketh, <em>saying</em>, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, <em>and</em> my locks with the drops of the night. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> My beloved put in his hand by the hole <em>of the door</em>, and my bowels were moved for him. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped <em>with</em> myrrh, and my fingers <em>with</em> sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, <em>and</em> was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me. <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I <em>am</em> sick of love. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> What <em>is</em> thy beloved more than <em>another</em> beloved, O thou fairest among women? what <em>is</em> thy beloved more than <em>another</em> beloved, that thou dost so charge us? <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> My beloved <em>is</em> white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> His head <em>is as</em> the most fine gold, his locks <em>are</em> bushy, <em>and</em> black as a raven. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> His eyes <em>are</em> as <em>the eyes</em> of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, <em>and</em> fitly set. <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> His cheeks <em>are</em> as a bed of spices, <em>as</em> sweet flowers: his lips <em>like</em> lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> His hands <em>are as</em> gold rings set with the beryl: his belly <em>is as</em> bright ivory overlaid <em>with</em> sapphires. <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> His legs <em>are as</em> pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance <em>is</em> as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> His mouth <em>is</em> most sweet: yea, he <em>is</em> altogether lovely. This <em>is</em> my beloved, and this <em>is</em> my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
