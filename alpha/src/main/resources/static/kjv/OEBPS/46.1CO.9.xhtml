<h2>1 Corinthians 9</h2>

<a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? <a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. <a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, <a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Have we not power to eat and to drink? <a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and <em>as</em> the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? <a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working? <a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? <a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? <a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? <a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Or saith he <em>it</em> altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, <em>this</em> is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. <a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> If we have sown unto you spiritual things, <em>is it</em> a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? <a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> If others be partakers of <em>this</em> power over you, <em>are</em> not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. <a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live <em>of the things</em> of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? <a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. <a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for <em>it were</em> better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. <a id="c9_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! <a id="c9_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation <em>of the gospel</em> is committed unto me. <a id="c9_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> What is my reward then? <em>Verily</em> that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. <a id="c9_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For though I be free from all <em>men</em>, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. <a id="c9_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; <a id="c9_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. <a id="c9_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all <em>men</em>, that I might by all means save some. <a id="c9_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with <em>you</em>. <a id="c9_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. <a id="c9_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they <em>do it</em> to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. <a id="c9_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: <a id="c9_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> But I keep under my body, and bring <em>it</em> into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
