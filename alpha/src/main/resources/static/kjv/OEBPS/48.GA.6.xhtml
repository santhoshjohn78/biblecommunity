<h2>Galatians 6</h2>

<a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For every man shall bear his own burden. <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all <em>men</em>, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. <a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. <a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. <a id="c6_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And as many as walk according to this rule, peace <em>be</em> on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. <a id="c6_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. <a id="c6_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <em>be</em> with your spirit. Amen.<blue> To <em>the</em> Galatians written from Rome.</blue>
