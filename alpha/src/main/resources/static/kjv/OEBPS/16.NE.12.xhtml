<em>namely</em>, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph: <a id="c12_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them. <a id="c12_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward. <a id="c12_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And the other <em>company of them that gave</em> thanks went over against <em>them</em>, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall; <a id="c12_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate. <a id="c12_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> So stood the two <em>companies of them that gave</em> thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me: <a id="c12_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, <em>and</em> Hananiah, with trumpets; <a id="c12_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah <em>their</em> overseer. <a id="c12_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off. <a id="c12_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited. <a id="c12_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, <em>and</em> of Solomon his son. <a id="c12_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> For in the days of David and Asaph of old <em>there were</em> chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God. <a id="c12_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified <em>holy things</em> unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified <em>them</em> unto the children of Aaron.
