<h2>Colossians 3</h2>

<a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> When Christ, <em>who is</em> our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And have put on the new <em>man</em>, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond <em>nor</em> free: but Christ <em>is</em> all, and in all. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also <em>do</em> ye. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And above all these things <em>put on</em> charity, which is the bond of perfectness. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, <em>do</em> all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Husbands, love <em>your</em> wives, and be not bitter against them. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Children, obey <em>your</em> parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Fathers, provoke not your children <em>to anger</em>, lest they be discouraged. <a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Servants, obey in all things <em>your</em> masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God: <a id="c3_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And whatsoever ye do, do <em>it</em> heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; <a id="c3_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. <a id="c3_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
