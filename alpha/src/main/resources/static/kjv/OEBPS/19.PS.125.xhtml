<h2>Psalms 125</h2>

<a id="c125_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Song of degrees.</b> They that trust in the LORD <em>shall be</em> as mount Zion, <em>which</em> cannot be removed, <em>but</em> abideth for ever. <a id="c125_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> As the mountains <em>are</em> round about Jerusalem, so the LORD <em>is</em> round about his people from henceforth even for ever. <a id="c125_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. <a id="c125_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Do good, O LORD, unto <em>those that be</em> good, and <em>to them that are</em> upright in their hearts. <a id="c125_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: <em>but</em> peace <em>shall be</em> upon Israel.
