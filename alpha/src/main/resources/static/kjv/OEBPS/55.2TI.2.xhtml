<h2>2 Timothy 2</h2>

<a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of <em>this</em> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And if a man also strive for masteries, <em>yet</em> is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel: <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, <em>even</em> unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> <em>It is</em> a faithful saying: For if we be dead with <em>him</em>, we shall also live with <em>him</em>: <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> If we suffer, we shall also reign with <em>him</em>: if we deny <em>him</em>, he also will deny us: <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> If we believe not, <em>yet</em> he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Of these things put <em>them</em> in remembrance, charging <em>them</em> before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, <em>but</em> to the subverting of the hearers. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> But shun profane <em>and</em> vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness. <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; <a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. <a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. <a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. <a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, <em>and</em> prepared unto every good work. <a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. <a id="c2_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. <a id="c2_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all <em>men</em>, apt to teach, patient, <a id="c2_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; <a id="c2_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And <em>that</em> they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
