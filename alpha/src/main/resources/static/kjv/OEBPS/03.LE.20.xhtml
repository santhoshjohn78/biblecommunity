<h2>Leviticus 20</h2>

<a id="c20_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <a id="c20_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever <em>he be</em> of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth <em>any</em> of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones. <a id="c20_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. <a id="c20_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not: <a id="c20_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people. <a id="c20_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. <a id="c20_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I <em>am</em> the LORD your God. <a id="c20_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I <em>am</em> the LORD which sanctify you. <a id="c20_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood <em>shall be</em> upon him. <a id="c20_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the man that committeth adultery with <em>another</em> man's wife, <em>even he</em> that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. <a id="c20_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood <em>shall be</em> upon them. <a id="c20_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood <em>shall be</em> upon them. <a id="c20_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood <em>shall be</em> upon them. <a id="c20_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And if a man take a wife and her mother, it <em>is</em> wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you. <a id="c20_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast. <a id="c20_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood <em>shall be</em> upon them. <a id="c20_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it <em>is</em> a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity. <a id="c20_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people. <a id="c20_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity. <a id="c20_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless. <a id="c20_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it <em>is</em> an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless. <a id="c20_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out. <a id="c20_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. <a id="c20_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I <em>am</em> the LORD your God, which have separated you from <em>other</em> people. <a id="c20_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean. <a id="c20_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD <em>am</em> holy, and have severed you from <em>other</em> people, that ye should be mine. <a id="c20_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood <em>shall be</em> upon them.
