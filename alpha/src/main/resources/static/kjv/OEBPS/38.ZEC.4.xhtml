<h2>Zechariah 4</h2>

<a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep, <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all <em>of</em> gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which <em>are</em> upon the top thereof: <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And two olive trees by it, one upon the right <em>side</em> of the bowl, and the other upon the left <em>side</em> thereof. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What <em>are</em> these, my lord? <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This <em>is</em> the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Who <em>art</em> thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel <em>thou shalt become</em> a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone <em>thereof with</em> shoutings, <em>crying</em>, Grace, grace unto it. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel <em>with</em> those seven; they <em>are</em> the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Then answered I, and said unto him, What <em>are</em> these two olive trees upon the right <em>side</em> of the candlestick and upon the left <em>side</em> thereof? <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I answered again, and said unto him, What <em>be these</em> two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden <em>oil</em> out of themselves? <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these <em>be</em>? And I said, No, my lord. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Then said he, These <em>are</em> the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
