<h2>Revelation 15</h2>

<a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God. <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, <em>and</em> over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God. <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous <em>are</em> thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true <em>are</em> thy ways, thou King of saints. <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for <em>thou</em> only <em>art</em> holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest. <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: <a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. <a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. <a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.
