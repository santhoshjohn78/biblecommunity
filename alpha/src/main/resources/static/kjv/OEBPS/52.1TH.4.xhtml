<h2>1 Thessalonians 4</h2>

<a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort <em>you</em> by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, <em>so</em> ye would abound more and more. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For this is the will of God, <em>even</em> your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication: <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> That no <em>man</em> go beyond and defraud his brother in <em>any</em> matter: because that the Lord <em>is</em> the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more; <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you; <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and <em>that</em> ye may have lack of nothing. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive <em>and</em> remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Then we which are alive <em>and</em> remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
