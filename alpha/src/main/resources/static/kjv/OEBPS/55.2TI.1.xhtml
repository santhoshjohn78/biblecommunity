<h2>2 Timothy 1</h2>

<a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> To Timothy, <em>my</em> dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, <em>and</em> peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I thank God, whom I serve from <em>my</em> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day; <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God; <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Who hath saved us, and called <em>us</em> with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel: <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found <em>me</em>. <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
