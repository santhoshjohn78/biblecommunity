<h2>Jeremiah 50</h2>

<a id="c50_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The word that the LORD spake against Babylon <em>and</em> against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet. <a id="c50_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, <em>and</em> conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces. <a id="c50_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast. <a id="c50_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God. <a id="c50_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, <em>saying</em>, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant <em>that</em> shall not be forgotten. <a id="c50_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away <em>on</em> the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace. <a id="c50_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers. <a id="c50_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks. <a id="c50_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows <em>shall be</em> as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain. <a id="c50_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD. <a id="c50_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls; <a id="c50_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations <em>shall be</em> a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. <a id="c50_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. <a id="c50_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD. <a id="c50_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it <em>is</em> the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her. <a id="c50_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land. <a id="c50_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Israel <em>is</em> a scattered sheep; the lions have driven <em>him</em> away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. <a id="c50_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. <a id="c50_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead. <a id="c50_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and <em>there shall be</em> none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve. <a id="c50_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Go up against the land of Merathaim, <em>even</em> against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee. <a id="c50_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> A sound of battle <em>is</em> in the land, and of great destruction. <a id="c50_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! <a id="c50_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD. <a id="c50_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this <em>is</em> the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans. <a id="c50_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left. <a id="c50_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. <a id="c50_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple. <a id="c50_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel. <a id="c50_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD. <a id="c50_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Behold, I <em>am</em> against thee, <em>O thou</em> most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time <em>that</em> I will visit thee. <a id="c50_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him. <a id="c50_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah <em>were</em> oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go. <a id="c50_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Their Redeemer <em>is</em> strong; the LORD of hosts <em>is</em> his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon. <a id="c50_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> A sword <em>is</em> upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise <em>men</em>. <a id="c50_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> A sword <em>is</em> upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword <em>is</em> upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed. <a id="c50_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> A sword <em>is</em> upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that <em>are</em> in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword <em>is</em> upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed. <a id="c50_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> A drought <em>is</em> upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it <em>is</em> the land of graven images, and they are mad upon <em>their</em> idols. <a id="c50_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell <em>there</em>, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. <a id="c50_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour <em>cities</em> thereof, saith the LORD; <em>so</em> shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein. <a id="c50_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. <a id="c50_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> They shall hold the bow and the lance: they <em>are</em> cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, <em>every one</em> put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon. <a id="c50_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, <em>and</em> pangs as of a woman in travail. <a id="c50_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who <em>is</em> a chosen <em>man, that</em> I may appoint over her? for who <em>is</em> like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who <em>is</em> that shepherd that will stand before me? <a id="c50_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make <em>their</em> habitation desolate with them. <a id="c50_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.
