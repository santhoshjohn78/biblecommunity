<h2>Psalms 127</h2>

<a id="c127_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Song of degrees for Solomon.</b> Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh <em>but</em> in vain. <a id="c127_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> <em>It is</em> vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: <em>for</em> so he giveth his beloved sleep. <a id="c127_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Lo, children <em>are</em> an heritage of the LORD: <em>and</em> the fruit of the womb <em>is his</em> reward. <a id="c127_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> As arrows <em>are</em> in the hand of a mighty man; so <em>are</em> children of the youth. <a id="c127_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Happy <em>is</em> the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
