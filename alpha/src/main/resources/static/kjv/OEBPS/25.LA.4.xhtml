<h2>Lamentations 4</h2>

<a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> How is the gold become dim! <em>how</em> is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people <em>is become</em> cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, <em>and</em> no man breaketh <em>it</em> unto them. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing <em>was</em> of sapphire: <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> <em>They that be</em> slain with the sword are better than <em>they that be</em> slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for <em>want of</em> the fruits of the field. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof. <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For the sins of her prophets, <em>and</em> the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her, <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> They have wandered <em>as</em> blind <em>men</em> in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> They cried unto them, Depart ye; <em>it is</em> unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn <em>there</em>. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders. <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation <em>that</em> could not save <em>us</em>. <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. <a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. <a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen. <a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. <a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.
