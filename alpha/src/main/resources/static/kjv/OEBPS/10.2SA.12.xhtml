<h2>2 Samuel 12</h2>

<a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The rich <em>man</em> had exceeding many flocks and herds: <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But the poor <em>man</em> had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, <em>As</em> the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this <em>thing</em> shall surely die: <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Nathan said to David, Thou <em>art</em> the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if <em>that had been</em> too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things. <a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife <em>to be</em> thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. <a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. <a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give <em>them</em> unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. <a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For thou didst <em>it</em> secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun. <a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. <a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also <em>that is</em> born unto thee shall surely die. <a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick. <a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth. <a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the elders of his house arose, <em>and went</em> to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them. <a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead? <a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead. <a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed <em>himself</em>, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat. <a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Then said his servants unto him, What thing <em>is</em> this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, <em>while it was</em> alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread. <a id="c12_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell <em>whether</em> GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live? <a id="c12_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me. <a id="c12_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him. <a id="c12_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD. <a id="c12_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. <a id="c12_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters. <a id="c12_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name. <a id="c12_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it. <a id="c12_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof <em>was</em> a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was <em>set</em> on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance. <a id="c12_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And he brought forth the people that <em>were</em> therein, and put <em>them</em> under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.
