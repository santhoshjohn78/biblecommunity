<h2>Jeremiah 30</h2>

<a id="c30_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, <a id="c30_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book. <a id="c30_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it. <a id="c30_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And these <em>are</em> the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah. <a id="c30_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. <a id="c30_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? <a id="c30_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Alas! for that day <em>is</em> great, so that none <em>is</em> like it: it <em>is</em> even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it. <a id="c30_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, <em>that</em> I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him: <a id="c30_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them. <a id="c30_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make <em>him</em> afraid. <a id="c30_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For I <em>am</em> with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished. <a id="c30_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise <em>is</em> incurable, <em>and</em> thy wound <em>is</em> grievous. <a id="c30_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> <em>There is</em> none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines. <a id="c30_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; <em>because</em> thy sins were increased. <a id="c30_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow <em>is</em> incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: <em>because</em> thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee. <a id="c30_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey. <a id="c30_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, <em>saying</em>, This <em>is</em> Zion, whom no man seeketh after. <a id="c30_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof. <a id="c30_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small. <a id="c30_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them. <a id="c30_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who <em>is</em> this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD. <a id="c30_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. <a id="c30_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. <a id="c30_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done <em>it</em>, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.
