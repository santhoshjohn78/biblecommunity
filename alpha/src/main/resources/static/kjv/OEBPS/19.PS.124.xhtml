<h2>Psalms 124</h2>

<a id="c124_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Song of degrees of David.</b> If <em>it had not been</em> the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say; <a id="c124_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> If <em>it had not been</em> the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us: <a id="c124_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: <a id="c124_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: <a id="c124_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. <a id="c124_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Blessed <em>be</em> the LORD, who hath not given us <em>as</em> a prey to their teeth. <a id="c124_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. <a id="c124_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Our help <em>is</em> in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
