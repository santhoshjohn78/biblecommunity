<h2>Proverbs 11</h2>

<a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A false balance <em>is</em> abomination to the LORD: but a just weight <em>is</em> his delight. <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> <em>When</em> pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly <em>is</em> wisdom. <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them. <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death. <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in <em>their own</em> naughtiness. <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> When a wicked man dieth, <em>his</em> expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust <em>men</em> perisheth. <a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead. <a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> An hypocrite with <em>his</em> mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered. <a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, <em>there is</em> shouting. <a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. <a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace. <a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter. <a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Where no counsel <em>is</em>, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors <em>there is</em> safety. <a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> He that is surety for a stranger shall smart <em>for it</em>: and he that hateth suretiship is sure. <a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong <em>men</em> retain riches. <a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but <em>he that is</em> cruel troubleth his own flesh. <a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness <em>shall be</em> a sure reward. <a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> As righteousness <em>tendeth</em> to life: so he that pursueth evil <em>pursueth it</em> to his own death. <a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> They that are of a froward heart <em>are</em> abomination to the LORD: but <em>such as are</em> upright in <em>their</em> way <em>are</em> his delight. <a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> <em>Though</em> hand <em>join</em> in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered. <a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> <em>As</em> a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, <em>so is</em> a fair woman which is without discretion. <a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The desire of the righteous <em>is</em> only good: <em>but</em> the expectation of the wicked <em>is</em> wrath. <a id="c11_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and <em>there is</em> that withholdeth more than is meet, but <em>it tendeth</em> to poverty. <a id="c11_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself. <a id="c11_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing <em>shall be</em> upon the head of him that selleth <em>it</em>. <a id="c11_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him. <a id="c11_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch. <a id="c11_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool <em>shall be</em> servant to the wise of heart. <a id="c11_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> The fruit of the righteous <em>is</em> a tree of life; and he that winneth souls <em>is</em> wise. <a id="c11_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.
