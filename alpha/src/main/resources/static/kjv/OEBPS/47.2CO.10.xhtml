<h2>2 Corinthians 10</h2>

<a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence <em>am</em> base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: <a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> But I beseech <em>you</em>, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. <a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: <a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> (For the weapons of our warfare <em>are</em> not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) <a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; <a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled. <a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he <em>is</em> Christ's, even so <em>are</em> we Christ's. <a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: <a id="c10_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. <a id="c10_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For <em>his</em> letters, say they, <em>are</em> weighty and powerful; but <em>his</em> bodily presence <em>is</em> weak, and <em>his</em> speech contemptible. <a id="c10_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such <em>will we be</em> also in deed when we are present. <a id="c10_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. <a id="c10_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But we will not boast of things without <em>our</em> measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you. <a id="c10_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For we stretch not ourselves beyond <em>our measure</em>, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in <em>preaching</em> the gospel of Christ: <a id="c10_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Not boasting of things without <em>our</em> measure, <em>that is</em>, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, <a id="c10_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> To preach the gospel in the <em>regions</em> beyond you, <em>and</em> not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand. <a id="c10_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. <a id="c10_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
