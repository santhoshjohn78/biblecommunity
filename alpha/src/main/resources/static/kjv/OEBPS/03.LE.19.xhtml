<h2>Leviticus 19</h2>

<a id="c19_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <a id="c19_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God <em>am</em> holy. <a id="c19_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I <em>am</em> the LORD your God. <a id="c19_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I <em>am</em> the LORD your God. <a id="c19_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will. <a id="c19_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire. <a id="c19_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it <em>is</em> abominable; it shall not be accepted. <a id="c19_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore <em>every one</em> that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. <a id="c19_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest. <a id="c19_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather <em>every</em> grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I <em>am</em> the LORD your God. <a id="c19_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another. <a id="c19_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I <em>am</em> the LORD. <a id="c19_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob <em>him</em>: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning. <a id="c19_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I <em>am</em> the LORD. <a id="c19_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: <em>but</em> in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour. <a id="c19_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Thou shalt not go up and down <em>as</em> a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I <em>am</em> the LORD. <a id="c19_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him. <a id="c19_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I <em>am</em> the LORD. <a id="c19_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee. <a id="c19_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that <em>is</em> a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. <a id="c19_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, <em>even</em> a ram for a trespass offering. <a id="c19_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him. <a id="c19_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of. <a id="c19_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD <em>withal</em>. <a id="c19_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I <em>am</em> the LORD your God. <a id="c19_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Ye shall not eat <em>any thing</em> with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times. <a id="c19_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. <a id="c19_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I <em>am</em> the LORD. <a id="c19_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness. <a id="c19_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I <em>am</em> the LORD. <a id="c19_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I <em>am</em> the LORD your God. <a id="c19_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I <em>am</em> the LORD. <a id="c19_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him. <a id="c19_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> <em>But</em> the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I <em>am</em> the LORD your God. <a id="c19_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. <a id="c19_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I <em>am</em> the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt. <a id="c19_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I <em>am</em> the LORD.
