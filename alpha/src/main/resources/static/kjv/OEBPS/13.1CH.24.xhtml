<h2>1 Chronicles 24</h2>

<a id="c24_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now <em>these are</em> the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. <a id="c24_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office. <a id="c24_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service. <a id="c24_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and <em>thus</em> were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar <em>there were</em> sixteen chief men of the house of <em>their</em> fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers. <a id="c24_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors <em>of the house</em> of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. <a id="c24_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, <em>one</em> of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and <em>before</em> the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and <em>one</em> taken for Ithamar. <a id="c24_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, <a id="c24_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, <a id="c24_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, <a id="c24_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, <a id="c24_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, <a id="c24_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, <a id="c24_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, <a id="c24_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, <a id="c24_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses, <a id="c24_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel, <a id="c24_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul, <a id="c24_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah. <a id="c24_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> These <em>were</em> the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him. <a id="c24_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And the rest of the sons of Levi <em>were these</em>: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah. <a id="c24_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first <em>was</em> Isshiah. <a id="c24_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath. <a id="c24_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And the sons <em>of Hebron</em>; Jeriah <em>the first</em>, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. <a id="c24_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> <em>Of</em> the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir. <a id="c24_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The brother of Michah <em>was</em> Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah. <a id="c24_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> The sons of Merari <em>were</em> Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno. <a id="c24_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri. <a id="c24_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Of Mahli <em>came</em> Eleazar, who had no sons. <a id="c24_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Concerning Kish: the son of Kish <em>was</em> Jerahmeel. <a id="c24_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These <em>were</em> the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers. <a id="c24_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.
