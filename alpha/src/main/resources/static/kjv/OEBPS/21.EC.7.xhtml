<h2>Ecclesiastes 7</h2>

<a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A good name <em>is</em> better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth. <a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> <em>It is</em> better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that <em>is</em> the end of all men; and the living will lay <em>it</em> to his heart. <a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Sorrow <em>is</em> better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. <a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The heart of the wise <em>is</em> in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools <em>is</em> in the house of mirth. <a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> <em>It is</em> better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. <a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so <em>is</em> the laughter of the fool: this also <em>is</em> vanity. <a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. <a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Better <em>is</em> the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: <em>and</em> the patient in spirit <em>is</em> better than the proud in spirit. <a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. <a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Say not thou, What is <em>the cause</em> that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this. <a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Wisdom <em>is</em> good with an inheritance: and <em>by it there is</em> profit to them that see the sun. <a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For wisdom <em>is</em> a defence, <em>and</em> money <em>is</em> a defence: but the excellency of knowledge <em>is, that</em> wisdom giveth life to them that have it. <a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Consider the work of God: for who can make <em>that</em> straight, which he hath made crooked? <a id="c7_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. <a id="c7_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> All <em>things</em> have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just <em>man</em> that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked <em>man</em> that prolongeth <em>his life</em> in his wickedness. <a id="c7_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? <a id="c7_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? <a id="c7_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> <em>It is</em> good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all. <a id="c7_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty <em>men</em> which are in the city. <a id="c7_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For <em>there is</em> not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. <a id="c7_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: <a id="c7_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. <a id="c7_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it <em>was</em> far from me. <a id="c7_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? <a id="c7_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason <em>of things</em>, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness <em>and</em> madness: <a id="c7_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart <em>is</em> snares and nets, <em>and</em> her hands <em>as</em> bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. <a id="c7_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, <em>counting</em> one by one, to find out the account: <a id="c7_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. <a id="c7_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
