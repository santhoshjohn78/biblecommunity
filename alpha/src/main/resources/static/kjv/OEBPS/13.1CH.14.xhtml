<h2>1 Chronicles 14</h2>

<a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house. <a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel. <a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters. <a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Now these <em>are</em> the names of <em>his</em> children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, <a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet, <a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, <a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet. <a id="c14_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard <em>of it</em>, and went out against them. <a id="c14_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. <a id="c14_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand. <a id="c14_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim. <a id="c14_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire. <a id="c14_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. <a id="c14_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. <a id="c14_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, <em>that</em> then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. <a id="c14_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. <a id="c14_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.
