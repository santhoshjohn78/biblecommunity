<h2>2 Samuel 15</h2>

<a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was <em>so</em>, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city <em>art</em> thou? And he said, Thy servant <em>is</em> of one of the tribes of Israel. <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters <em>are</em> good and right; but <em>there is</em> no man <em>deputed</em> of the king to hear thee. <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And it was <em>so</em>, that when any man came nigh <em>to him</em> to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him. <a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. <a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron. <a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD. <a id="c15_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. <a id="c15_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron. <a id="c15_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, <em>that were</em> called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing. <a id="c15_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, <em>even</em> from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom. <a id="c15_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. <a id="c15_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And David said unto all his servants that <em>were</em> with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not <em>else</em> escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. <a id="c15_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants <em>are ready to do</em> whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint. <a id="c15_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, <em>which were</em> concubines, to keep the house. <a id="c15_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off. <a id="c15_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king. <a id="c15_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou <em>art</em> a stranger, and also an exile. <a id="c15_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Whereas thou camest <em>but</em> yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth <em>be</em> with thee. <a id="c15_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Ittai answered the king, and said, <em>As</em> the LORD liveth, and <em>as</em> my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be. <a id="c15_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that <em>were</em> with him. <a id="c15_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness. <a id="c15_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites <em>were</em> with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city. <a id="c15_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me <em>both</em> it, and his habitation: <a id="c15_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, <em>here am</em> I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him. <a id="c15_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The king said also unto Zadok the priest, <em>Art not</em> thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. <a id="c15_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me. <a id="c15_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there. <a id="c15_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And David went up by the ascent of <em>mount</em> Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that <em>was</em> with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. <a id="c15_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And <em>one</em> told David, saying, Ahithophel <em>is</em> among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness. <a id="c15_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And it came to pass, that <em>when</em> David was come to the top <em>of the mount</em>, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: <a id="c15_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me: <a id="c15_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; <em>as</em> I <em>have been</em> thy father's servant hitherto, so <em>will</em> I now also <em>be</em> thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. <a id="c15_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And <em>hast thou</em> not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, <em>that</em> what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell <em>it</em> to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. <a id="c15_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Behold, <em>they have</em> there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's <em>son</em>, and Jonathan Abiathar's <em>son</em>; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear. <a id="c15_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
