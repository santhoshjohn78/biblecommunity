<h2>Song of Solomon 7</h2>

<a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs <em>are</em> like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman. <a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thy navel <em>is like</em> a round goblet, <em>which</em> wanteth not liquor: thy belly <em>is like</em> an heap of wheat set about with lilies. <a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thy two breasts <em>are</em> like two young roes <em>that are</em> twins. <a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thy neck <em>is</em> as a tower of ivory; thine eyes <em>like</em> the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose <em>is</em> as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus. <a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thine head upon thee <em>is</em> like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king <em>is</em> held in the galleries. <a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! <a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters <em>of grapes</em>. <a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples; <a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth <em>down</em> sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak. <a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I <em>am</em> my beloved's, and his desire <em>is</em> toward me. <a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages. <a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, <em>whether</em> the tender grape appear, <em>and</em> the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves. <a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates <em>are</em> all manner of pleasant <em>fruits</em>, new and old, <em>which</em> I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
