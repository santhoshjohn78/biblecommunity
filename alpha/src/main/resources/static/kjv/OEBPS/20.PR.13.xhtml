<h2>Proverbs 13</h2>

<a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A wise son <em>heareth</em> his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke. <a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> A man shall eat good by the fruit of <em>his</em> mouth: but the soul of the transgressors <em>shall eat</em> violence. <a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: <em>but</em> he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction. <a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The soul of the sluggard desireth, and <em>hath</em> nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. <a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> A righteous <em>man</em> hateth lying: but a wicked <em>man</em> is loathsome, and cometh to shame. <a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Righteousness keepeth <em>him that is</em> upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner. <a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> There is that maketh himself rich, yet <em>hath</em> nothing: <em>there is</em> that maketh himself poor, yet <em>hath</em> great riches. <a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The ransom of a man's life <em>are</em> his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke. <a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. <a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised <em>is</em> wisdom. <a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Wealth <em>gotten</em> by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase. <a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but <em>when</em> the desire cometh, <em>it is</em> a tree of life. <a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. <a id="c13_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The law of the wise <em>is</em> a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. <a id="c13_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors <em>is</em> hard. <a id="c13_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Every prudent <em>man</em> dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open <em>his</em> folly. <a id="c13_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador <em>is</em> health. <a id="c13_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Poverty and shame <em>shall be to</em> him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. <a id="c13_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but <em>it is</em> abomination to fools to depart from evil. <a id="c13_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> He that walketh with wise <em>men</em> shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed. <a id="c13_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed. <a id="c13_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> A good <em>man</em> leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner <em>is</em> laid up for the just. <a id="c13_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Much food <em>is in</em> the tillage of the poor: but there is <em>that is</em> destroyed for want of judgment. <a id="c13_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. <a id="c13_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want.
