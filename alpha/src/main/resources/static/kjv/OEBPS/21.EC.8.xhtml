<h2>Ecclesiastes 8</h2>

<a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Who <em>is</em> as the wise <em>man</em>? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed. <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I <em>counsel thee</em> to keep the king's commandment, and <em>that</em> in regard of the oath of God. <a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Where the word of a king <em>is, there is</em> power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou? <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment. <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man <em>is</em> great upon him. <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be? <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> <em>There is</em> no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither <em>hath he</em> power in the day of death: and <em>there is</em> no discharge in <em>that</em> war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it. <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: <em>there is</em> a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt. <a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this <em>is</em> also vanity. <a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. <a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his <em>days</em> be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him: <a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong <em>his</em> days, <em>which are</em> as a shadow; because he feareth not before God. <a id="c8_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just <em>men</em>, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked <em>men</em>, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also <em>is</em> vanity. <a id="c8_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun. <a id="c8_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also <em>there is that</em> neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) <a id="c8_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek <em>it</em> out, yet he shall not find <em>it</em>; yea further; though a wise <em>man</em> think to know <em>it</em>, yet shall he not be able to find <em>it</em>.
