<h2>Psalms 146</h2>

<a id="c146_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul. <a id="c146_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. <a id="c146_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Put not your trust in princes, <em>nor</em> in the son of man, in whom <em>there is</em> no help. <a id="c146_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. <a id="c146_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Happy <em>is he</em> that <em>hath</em> the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope <em>is</em> in the LORD his God: <a id="c146_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein <em>is</em>: which keepeth truth for ever: <a id="c146_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners: <a id="c146_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The LORD openeth <em>the eyes of</em> the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous: <a id="c146_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. <a id="c146_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The LORD shall reign for ever, <em>even</em> thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.
