<h2>Psalms 70</h2>

<a id="c70_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>To the chief Musician, <em>A Psalm</em> of David, to bring to remembrance.</b> <em>Make haste</em>, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD. <a id="c70_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. <a id="c70_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha. <a id="c70_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. <a id="c70_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But I <em>am</em> poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou <em>art</em> my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
