<h2>1 Corinthians 1</h2>

<a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, called <em>to be</em> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes <em>our</em> brother, <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <em>to be</em> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours: <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Grace <em>be</em> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <em>from</em> the Lord Jesus Christ. <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and <em>in</em> all knowledge; <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Who shall also confirm you unto the end, <em>that ye may be</em> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> God <em>is</em> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <em>that</em> there be no divisions among you; but <em>that</em> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them <em>which are of the house</em> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius; <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other. <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. <a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. <a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Where <em>is</em> the wise? where <em>is</em> the scribe? where <em>is</em> the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? <a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. <a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: <a id="c1_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; <a id="c1_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. <a id="c1_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. <a id="c1_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, <em>are called</em>: <a id="c1_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; <a id="c1_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, <em>yea</em>, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: <a id="c1_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> That no flesh should glory in his presence. <a id="c1_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: <a id="c1_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
