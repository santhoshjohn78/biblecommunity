<h2>Song of Solomon 6</h2>

<a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee. <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I <em>am</em> my beloved's, and my beloved <em>is</em> mine: he feedeth among the lilies. <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thou <em>art</em> beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as <em>an army</em> with banners. <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair <em>is</em> as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead. <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thy teeth <em>are</em> as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and <em>there is</em> not one barren among them. <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> As a piece of a pomegranate <em>are</em> thy temples within thy locks. <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number. <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> My dove, my undefiled is <em>but</em> one; she <em>is</em> the <em>only</em> one of her mother, she <em>is</em> the choice <em>one</em> of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; <em>yea</em>, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Who <em>is</em> she <em>that</em> looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, <em>and</em> terrible as <em>an army</em> with banners? <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, <em>and</em> to see whether the vine flourished, <em>and</em> the pomegranates budded. <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Or ever I was aware, my soul made me <em>like</em> the chariots of Amminadib. <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.
