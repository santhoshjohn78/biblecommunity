<h2>Psalms 130</h2>

<a id="c130_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Song of degrees.</b> Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD. <a id="c130_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. <a id="c130_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? <a id="c130_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> But <em>there is</em> forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. <a id="c130_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. <a id="c130_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> My soul <em>waiteth</em> for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: <em>I say, more than</em> they that watch for the morning. <a id="c130_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD <em>there is</em> mercy, and with him <em>is</em> plenteous redemption. <a id="c130_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
