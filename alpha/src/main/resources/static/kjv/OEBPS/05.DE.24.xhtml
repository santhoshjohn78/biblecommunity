<h2>Deuteronomy 24</h2>

<a id="c24_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give <em>it</em> in her hand, and send her out of his house. <a id="c24_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's <em>wife</em>. <a id="c24_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And <em>if</em> the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth <em>it</em> in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her <em>to be</em> his wife; <a id="c24_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that <em>is</em> abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee <em>for</em> an inheritance. <a id="c24_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: <em>but</em> he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken. <a id="c24_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh <em>a man's</em> life to pledge. <a id="c24_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you. <a id="c24_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, <em>so</em> ye shall observe to do. <a id="c24_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt. <a id="c24_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge. <a id="c24_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee. <a id="c24_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And if the man <em>be</em> poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge: <a id="c24_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God. <a id="c24_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant <em>that is</em> poor and needy, <em>whether he be</em> of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that <em>are</em> in thy land within thy gates: <a id="c24_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> At his day thou shalt give <em>him</em> his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he <em>is</em> poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee. <a id="c24_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin. <a id="c24_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, <em>nor</em> of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge: <a id="c24_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing. <a id="c24_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands. <a id="c24_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. <a id="c24_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean <em>it</em> afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. <a id="c24_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.
