<h2>Psalms 100</h2>

<a id="c100_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Psalm of praise.</b> Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. <a id="c100_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing. <a id="c100_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Know ye that the LORD he <em>is</em> God: <em>it is</em> he <em>that</em> hath made us, and not we ourselves; <em>we are</em> his people, and the sheep of his pasture. <a id="c100_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, <em>and</em> into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, <em>and</em> bless his name. <a id="c100_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For the LORD <em>is</em> good; his mercy <em>is</em> everlasting; and his truth <em>endureth</em> to all generations.
