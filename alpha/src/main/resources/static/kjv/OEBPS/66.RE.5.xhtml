<h2>Revelation 5</h2>

<a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four <em>and</em> twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, <em>be</em> unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four <em>and</em> twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.
