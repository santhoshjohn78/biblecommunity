<h2>Philippians 4</h2>

<a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, <em>my</em> dearly beloved. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and <em>with</em> other my fellowlabourers, whose names <em>are</em> in the book of life. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Rejoice in the Lord alway: <em>and</em> again I say, Rejoice. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord <em>is</em> at hand. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things <em>are</em> honest, whatsoever things <em>are</em> just, whatsoever things <em>are</em> pure, whatsoever things <em>are</em> lovely, whatsoever things <em>are</em> of good report; if <em>there be</em> any virtue, and if <em>there be</em> any praise, think on these things. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, <em>therewith</em> to be content. <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things <em>which were sent</em> from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. <a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. <a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Now unto God and our Father <em>be</em> glory for ever and ever. Amen. <a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you. <a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household. <a id="c4_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <em>be</em> with you all. Amen.<blue> To <em>the</em> Philippians written from Rome, by Epaphroditus.</blue>
