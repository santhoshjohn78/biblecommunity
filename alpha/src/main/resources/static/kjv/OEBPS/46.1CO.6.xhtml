<h2>1 Corinthians 6</h2>

<a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints? <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather <em>suffer yourselves to</em> be defrauded? <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that <em>your</em> brethren. <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body <em>is</em> not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. <a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power. <a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make <em>them</em> the members of an harlot? God forbid. <a id="c6_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. <a id="c6_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. <a id="c6_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. <a id="c6_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost <em>which is</em> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? <a id="c6_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
