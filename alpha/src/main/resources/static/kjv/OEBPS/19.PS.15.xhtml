<h2>Psalms 15</h2>

<a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Psalm of David.</b> LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> <em>He that</em> backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. <em>He that</em> sweareth to <em>his own</em> hurt, and changeth not. <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> <em>He that</em> putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these <em>things</em> shall never be moved.
