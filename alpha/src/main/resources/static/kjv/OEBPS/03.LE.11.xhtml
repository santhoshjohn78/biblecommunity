<h2>Leviticus 11</h2>

<a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These <em>are</em> the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that <em>are</em> on the earth. <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, <em>and</em> cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: <em>as</em> the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <em>is</em> unclean unto you. <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <em>is</em> unclean unto you. <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <em>is</em> unclean unto you. <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he <em>is</em> unclean to you. <a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they <em>are</em> unclean to you. <a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> These shall ye eat of all that <em>are</em> in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat. <a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which <em>is</em> in the waters, they <em>shall be</em> an abomination unto you: <a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination. <a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that <em>shall be</em> an abomination unto you. <a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And these <em>are they which</em> ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they <em>are</em> an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, <a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the vulture, and the kite after his kind; <a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Every raven after his kind; <a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, <a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, <a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, <a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. <a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> All fowls that creep, going upon <em>all</em> four, <em>shall be</em> an abomination unto you. <a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon <em>all</em> four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth; <a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> <em>Even</em> these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind. <a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> But all <em>other</em> flying creeping things, which have four feet, <em>shall be</em> an abomination unto you. <a id="c11_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even. <a id="c11_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And whosoever beareth <em>ought</em> of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. <a id="c11_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> <em>The carcases</em> of every beast which divideth the hoof, and <em>is</em> not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, <em>are</em> unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean. <a id="c11_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on <em>all</em> four, those <em>are</em> unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even. <a id="c11_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they <em>are</em> unclean unto you. <a id="c11_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> These also <em>shall be</em> unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind, <a id="c11_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole. <a id="c11_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> These <em>are</em> unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even. <a id="c11_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And upon whatsoever <em>any</em> of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether <em>it be</em> any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel <em>it be</em>, wherein <em>any</em> work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed. <a id="c11_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And every earthen vessel, whereinto <em>any</em> of them falleth, whatsoever <em>is</em> in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it. <a id="c11_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Of all meat which may be eaten, <em>that</em> on which <em>such</em> water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every <em>such</em> vessel shall be unclean. <a id="c11_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And every <em>thing</em> whereupon <em>any part</em> of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; <em>whether it be</em> oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: <em>for</em> they <em>are</em> unclean, and shall be unclean unto you. <a id="c11_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Nevertheless a fountain or pit, <em>wherein there is</em> plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean. <a id="c11_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And if <em>any part</em> of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it <em>shall be</em> clean. <a id="c11_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> But if <em>any</em> water be put upon the seed, and <em>any part</em> of their carcase fall thereon, it <em>shall be</em> unclean unto you. <a id="c11_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even. <a id="c11_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. <a id="c11_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth <em>shall be</em> an abomination; it shall not be eaten. <a id="c11_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon <em>all</em> four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they <em>are</em> an abomination. <a id="c11_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby. <a id="c11_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> For I <em>am</em> the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I <em>am</em> holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. <a id="c11_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> For I <em>am</em> the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I <em>am</em> holy. <a id="c11_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> This <em>is</em> the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth: <a id="c11_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.
