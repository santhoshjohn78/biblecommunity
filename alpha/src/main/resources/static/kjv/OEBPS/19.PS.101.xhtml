<h2>Psalms 101</h2>

<a id="c101_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Psalm of David.</b> I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing. <a id="c101_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. <a id="c101_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; <em>it</em> shall not cleave to me. <a id="c101_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked <em>person</em>. <a id="c101_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. <a id="c101_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Mine eyes <em>shall be</em> upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. <a id="c101_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. <a id="c101_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.
