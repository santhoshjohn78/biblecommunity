<h2>Leviticus 9</h2>

<a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass on the eighth day, <em>that</em> Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; <a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer <em>them</em> before the LORD. <a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, <em>both</em> of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; <a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you. <a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And they brought <em>that</em> which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD. <a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Moses said, This <em>is</em> the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you. <a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded. <a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which <em>was</em> for himself. <a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put <em>it</em> upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: <a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses. <a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp. <a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar. <a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt <em>them</em> upon the altar. <a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt <em>them</em> upon the burnt offering on the altar. <a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which <em>was</em> the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. <a id="c9_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner. <a id="c9_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt <em>it</em> upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning. <a id="c9_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> He slew also the bullock and the ram <em>for</em> a sacrifice of peace offerings, which <em>was</em> for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, <a id="c9_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth <em>the inwards</em>, and the kidneys, and the caul <em>above</em> the liver: <a id="c9_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar: <a id="c9_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved <em>for</em> a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded. <a id="c9_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings. <a id="c9_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people. <a id="c9_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: <em>which</em> when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
