<h2>Malachi 4</h2>

<a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do <em>this</em>, saith the LORD of hosts. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, <em>with</em> the statutes and judgments. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD: <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
