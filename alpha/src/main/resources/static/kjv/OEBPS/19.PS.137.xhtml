<h2>Psalms 137</h2>

<a id="c137_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. <a id="c137_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. <a id="c137_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us <em>required of us</em> mirth, <em>saying</em>, Sing us <em>one</em> of the songs of Zion. <a id="c137_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> How shall we sing the LORD'S song in a strange land? <a id="c137_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget <em>her cunning</em>. <a id="c137_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. <a id="c137_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase <em>it</em>, rase <em>it, even</em> to the foundation thereof. <a id="c137_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy <em>shall he be</em>, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. <a id="c137_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Happy <em>shall he be</em>, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
