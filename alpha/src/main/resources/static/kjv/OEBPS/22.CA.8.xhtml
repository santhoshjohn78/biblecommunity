<h2>Song of Solomon 8</h2>

<a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> O that thou <em>wert</em> as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! <em>when</em> I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised. <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I would lead thee, <em>and</em> bring thee into my mother's house, <em>who</em> would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate. <a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> His left hand <em>should be</em> under my head, and his right hand should embrace me. <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake <em>my</em> love, until he please. <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Who <em>is</em> this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth <em>that</em> bare thee. <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love <em>is</em> strong as death; jealousy <em>is</em> cruel as the grave: the coals thereof <em>are</em> coals of fire, <em>which hath a</em> most vehement flame. <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if <em>a</em> man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned. <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for? <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> If she <em>be</em> a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she <em>be</em> a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar. <a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I <em>am</em> a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour. <a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand <em>pieces</em> of silver. <a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> My vineyard, which <em>is</em> mine, <em>is</em> before me: thou, O Solomon, <em>must have</em> a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred. <a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear <em>it</em>. <a id="c8_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
