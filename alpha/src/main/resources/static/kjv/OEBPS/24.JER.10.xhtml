<h2>Jeremiah 10</h2>

<a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: <a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. <a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For the customs of the people <em>are</em> vain: for <em>one</em> cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. <a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. <a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They <em>are</em> upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also <em>is it</em> in them to do good. <a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Forasmuch as <em>there is</em> none like unto thee, O LORD; thou <em>art</em> great, and thy name <em>is</em> great in might. <a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise <em>men</em> of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, <em>there is</em> none like unto thee. <a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock <em>is</em> a doctrine of vanities. <a id="c10_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple <em>is</em> their clothing: they <em>are</em> all the work of cunning <em>men</em>. <a id="c10_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But the LORD <em>is</em> the true God, he <em>is</em> the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation. <a id="c10_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, <em>even</em> they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. <a id="c10_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion. <a id="c10_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> When he uttereth his voice, <em>there is</em> a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. <a id="c10_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Every man is brutish in <em>his</em> knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image <em>is</em> falsehood, and <em>there is</em> no breath in them. <a id="c10_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> They <em>are</em> vanity, <em>and</em> the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. <a id="c10_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The portion of Jacob <em>is</em> not like them: for he <em>is</em> the former of all <em>things</em>; and Israel <em>is</em> the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts <em>is</em> his name. <a id="c10_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress. <a id="c10_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find <em>it so</em>. <a id="c10_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this <em>is</em> a grief, and I must bear it. <a id="c10_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they <em>are</em> not: <em>there is</em> none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. <a id="c10_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered. <a id="c10_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, <em>and</em> a den of dragons. <a id="c10_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> O LORD, I know that the way of man <em>is</em> not in himself: <em>it is</em> not in man that walketh to direct his steps. <a id="c10_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing. <a id="c10_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.
