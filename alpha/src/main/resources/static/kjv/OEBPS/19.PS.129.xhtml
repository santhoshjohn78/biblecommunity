<h2>Psalms 129</h2>

<a id="c129_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Song of degrees.</b> Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: <a id="c129_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me. <a id="c129_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. <a id="c129_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The LORD <em>is</em> righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. <a id="c129_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. <a id="c129_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let them be as the grass <em>upon</em> the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up: <a id="c129_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. <a id="c129_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD <em>be</em> upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
