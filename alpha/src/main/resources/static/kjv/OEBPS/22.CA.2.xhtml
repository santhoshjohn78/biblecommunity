<h2>Song of Solomon 2</h2>

<a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I <em>am</em> the rose of Sharon, <em>and</em> the lily of the valleys. <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> As the lily among thorns, so <em>is</em> my love among the daughters. <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so <em>is</em> my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit <em>was</em> sweet to my taste. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me <em>was</em> love. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I <em>am</em> sick of love. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> His left hand <em>is</em> under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake <em>my</em> love, till he please. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over <em>and</em> gone; <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing <em>of birds</em> is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines <em>with</em> the tender grape give a <em>good</em> smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> O my dove, <em>that art</em> in the clefts of the rock, in the secret <em>places</em> of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet <em>is</em> thy voice, and thy countenance <em>is</em> comely. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines <em>have</em> tender grapes. <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> My beloved <em>is</em> mine, and I <em>am</em> his: he feedeth among the lilies. <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
