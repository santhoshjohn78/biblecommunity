<h2>Ephesians 3</h2>

<a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward: <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And to make all <em>men</em> see what <em>is</em> the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly <em>places</em> might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> May be able to comprehend with all saints what <em>is</em> the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Unto him <em>be</em> glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.
