<h2>2 Corinthians 12</h2>

<a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but <em>now</em> I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me <em>to be</em>, or <em>that</em> he heareth of me. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. <a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. <a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. <a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing. <a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. <a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except <em>it be</em> that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong. <a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. <a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved. <a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile. <a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you? <a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> I desired Titus, and with <em>him</em> I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? <em>walked we</em> not in the same steps? <a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but <em>we do</em> all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying. <a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and <em>that</em> I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest <em>there be</em> debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: <a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> <em>And</em> lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and <em>that</em> I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
