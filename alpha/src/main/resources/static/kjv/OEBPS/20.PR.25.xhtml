<h2>Proverbs 25</h2>

<a id="c25_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> These<em> are</em> also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. <a id="c25_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> <em>It is</em> the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings<em> is</em> to search out a matter. <a id="c25_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings<em> is</em> unsearchable. <a id="c25_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. <a id="c25_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Take away the wicked<em> from</em> before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness. <a id="c25_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great<em> men</em>: <a id="c25_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For better<em> it is</em> that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. <a id="c25_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Go not forth hastily to strive, lest<em> thou know not</em> what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. <a id="c25_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Debate thy cause with thy neighbour<em> himself</em>; and discover not a secret to another: <a id="c25_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Lest he that heareth<em> it</em> put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away. <a id="c25_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> A word fitly spoken<em> is like</em> apples of gold in pictures of silver. <a id="c25_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> <em>As</em> an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,<em> so is</em> a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. <a id="c25_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,<em> so is</em> a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. <a id="c25_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift<em> is like</em> clouds and wind without rain. <a id="c25_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. <a id="c25_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. <a id="c25_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and<em> so</em> hate thee. <a id="c25_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour<em> is</em> a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. <a id="c25_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble<em> is like</em> a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. <a id="c25_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> <em>As</em> he that taketh away a garment in cold weather,<em> and as</em> vinegar upon nitre, so<em> is</em> he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. <a id="c25_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: <a id="c25_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee. <a id="c25_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The north wind driveth away rain: so<em> doth</em> an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. <a id="c25_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> <em>It is</em> better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. <a id="c25_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> <em>As</em> cold waters to a thirsty soul, so<em> is</em> good news from a far country. <a id="c25_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> A righteous man falling down before the wicked<em> is as</em> a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. <a id="c25_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> <em>It is</em> not good to eat much honey: so<em> for men</em> to search their own glory<em> is not</em> glory. <a id="c25_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> He that<em> hath</em> no rule over his own spirit<em> is like</em> a city<em> that is</em> broken down,<em> and</em> without walls.
