<h2>Revelation 2</h2>

<a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Nevertheless I have <em>somewhat</em> against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive; <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and <em>I know</em> the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but <em>are</em> the synagogue of Satan. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast <em>some</em> of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges; <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, <em>even</em> where Satan's seat <em>is</em>: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas <em>was</em> my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate. <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth <em>it</em>. <a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet <em>are</em> like fine brass; <a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last <em>to be</em> more than the first. <a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. <a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. <a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. <a id="c2_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. <a id="c2_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. <a id="c2_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> But that which ye have <em>already</em> hold fast till I come. <a id="c2_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: <a id="c2_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. <a id="c2_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And I will give him the morning star. <a id="c2_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
