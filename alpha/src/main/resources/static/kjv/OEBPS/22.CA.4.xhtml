<h2>Song of Solomon 4</h2>

<a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Behold, thou <em>art</em> fair, my love; behold, thou <em>art</em> fair; thou <em>hast</em> doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair <em>is</em> as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thy teeth <em>are</em> like a flock <em>of sheep that are even</em> shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none <em>is</em> barren among them. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thy lips <em>are</em> like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech <em>is</em> comely: thy temples <em>are</em> like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thy neck <em>is</em> like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thy two breasts <em>are</em> like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Thou <em>art</em> all fair, my love; <em>there is</em> no spot in thee. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Come with me from Lebanon, <em>my</em> spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, <em>my</em> spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> How fair is thy love, my sister, <em>my</em> spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices! <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Thy lips, O <em>my</em> spouse, drop <em>as</em> the honeycomb: honey and milk <em>are</em> under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments <em>is</em> like the smell of Lebanon. <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> A garden inclosed <em>is</em> my sister, <em>my</em> spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Thy plants <em>are</em> an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard, <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices: <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, <em>that</em> the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.
