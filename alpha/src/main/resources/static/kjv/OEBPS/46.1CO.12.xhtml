<h2>1 Corinthians 12</h2>

<a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now concerning spiritual <em>gifts</em>, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and <em>that</em> no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; <a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; <a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another <em>divers</em> kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: <a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. <a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also <em>is</em> Christ. <a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether <em>we be</em> Jews or Gentiles, whether <em>we be</em> bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. <a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For the body is not one member, but many. <a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? <a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? <a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> If the whole body <em>were</em> an eye, where <em>were</em> the hearing? If the whole <em>were</em> hearing, where <em>were</em> the smelling? <a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. <a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And if they were all one member, where <em>were</em> the body? <a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> But now <em>are they</em> many members, yet but one body. <a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. <a id="c12_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: <a id="c12_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And those <em>members</em> of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely <em>parts</em> have more abundant comeliness. <a id="c12_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> For our comely <em>parts</em> have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that <em>part</em> which lacked: <a id="c12_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> That there should be no schism in the body; but <em>that</em> the members should have the same care one for another. <a id="c12_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. <a id="c12_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. <a id="c12_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. <a id="c12_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> <em>Are</em> all apostles? <em>are</em> all prophets? <em>are</em> all teachers? <em>are</em> all workers of miracles? <a id="c12_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? <a id="c12_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
