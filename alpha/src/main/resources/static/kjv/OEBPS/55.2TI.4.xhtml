<h2>2 Timothy 4</h2>

<a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I charge <em>thee</em> therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And they shall turn away <em>their</em> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I have fought a good fight, I have finished <em>my</em> course, I have kept the faith: <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry. <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring <em>with thee</em>, and the books, <em>but</em> especially the parchments. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works: <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> At my first answer no man stood with me, but all <em>men</em> forsook me: <em>I pray God</em> that it may not be laid to their charge. <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and <em>that</em> all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve <em>me</em> unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom <em>be</em> glory for ever and ever. Amen. <a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. <a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick. <a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. <a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> The Lord Jesus Christ <em>be</em> with thy spirit. Grace <em>be</em> with you. Amen.<blue> The second <em>epistle</em> unto Timotheus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Ephesians, was written from Rome, when Paul was brought before Nero the second time.</blue>
