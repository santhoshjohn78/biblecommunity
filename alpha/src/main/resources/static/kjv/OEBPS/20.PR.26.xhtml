<h2>Proverbs 26</h2>

<a id="c26_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool. <a id="c26_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come. <a id="c26_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back. <a id="c26_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. <a id="c26_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. <a id="c26_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet,<em> and</em> drinketh damage. <a id="c26_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The legs of the lame are not equal: so<em> is</em> a parable in the mouth of fools. <a id="c26_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so<em> is</em> he that giveth honour to a fool. <a id="c26_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> <em>As</em> a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so<em> is</em> a parable in the mouth of fools. <a id="c26_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The great<em> God</em> that formed all<em> things</em> both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. <a id="c26_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> As a dog returneth to his vomit,<em> so</em> a fool returneth to his folly. <a id="c26_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?<em> there is</em> more hope of a fool than of him. <a id="c26_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The slothful<em> man</em> saith,<em> There is</em> a lion in the way; a lion<em> is</em> in the streets. <a id="c26_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> <em>As</em> the door turneth upon his hinges, so<em> doth</em> the slothful upon his bed. <a id="c26_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The slothful hideth his hand in<em> his</em> bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. <a id="c26_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The sluggard<em> is</em> wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. <a id="c26_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He that passeth by,<em> and</em> meddleth with strife<em> belonging</em> not to him,<em> is like</em> one that taketh a dog by the ears. <a id="c26_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> As a mad<em> man</em> who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, <a id="c26_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> So<em> is</em> the man<em> that</em> deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? <a id="c26_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Where no wood is,<em> there</em> the fire goeth out: so where<em> there is</em> no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. <a id="c26_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> <em>As</em> coals<em> are</em> to burning coals, and wood to fire; so<em> is</em> a contentious man to kindle strife. <a id="c26_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> The words of a talebearer<em> are</em> as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. <a id="c26_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Burning lips and a wicked heart<em> are like</em> a potsherd covered with silver dross. <a id="c26_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; <a id="c26_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for<em> there are</em> seven abominations in his heart. <a id="c26_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> <em>Whose</em> hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the<em> whole</em> congregation. <a id="c26_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. <a id="c26_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> A lying tongue hateth<em> those that are</em> afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
