<h2>Leviticus 4</h2>

<a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD <em>concerning things</em> which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them: <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the priest shall put <em>some</em> of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which <em>is</em> in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which <em>is at</em> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that <em>is</em> upon the inwards, <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the two kidneys, and the fat that <em>is</em> upon them, which <em>is</em> by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away, <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done <em>somewhat against</em> any of the commandments of the LORD <em>concerning things</em> which should not be done, and are guilty; <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation: <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the priest shall dip his finger <em>in some</em> of the blood, and sprinkle <em>it</em> seven times before the LORD, <em>even</em> before the vail. <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And he shall put <em>some</em> of the blood upon the horns of the altar which <em>is</em> before the LORD, that <em>is</em> in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which <em>is at</em> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. <a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn <em>it</em> upon the altar. <a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them. <a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it <em>is</em> a sin offering for the congregation. <a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> When a ruler hath sinned, and done <em>somewhat</em> through ignorance <em>against</em> any of the commandments of the LORD his God <em>concerning things</em> which should not be done, and is guilty; <a id="c4_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish: <a id="c4_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it <em>is</em> a sin offering. <a id="c4_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put <em>it</em> upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering. <a id="c4_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. <a id="c4_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth <em>somewhat against</em> any of the commandments of the LORD <em>concerning things</em> which ought not to be done, and be guilty; <a id="c4_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned. <a id="c4_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering. <a id="c4_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put <em>it</em> upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar. <a id="c4_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn <em>it</em> upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him. <a id="c4_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish. <a id="c4_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering. <a id="c4_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put <em>it</em> upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar: <a id="c4_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.
