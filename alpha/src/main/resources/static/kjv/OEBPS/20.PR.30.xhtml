<h2>Proverbs 30</h2>

<a id="c30_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, <em>even</em> the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal, <a id="c30_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Surely I <em>am</em> more brutish than <em>any</em> man, and have not the understanding of a man. <a id="c30_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy. <a id="c30_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what <em>is</em> his name, and what <em>is</em> his son's name, if thou canst tell? <a id="c30_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Every word of God <em>is</em> pure: he <em>is</em> a shield unto them that put their trust in him. <a id="c30_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. <a id="c30_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Two <em>things</em> have I required of thee; deny me <em>them</em> not before I die: <a id="c30_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: <a id="c30_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Lest I be full, and deny <em>thee</em>, and say, Who <em>is</em> the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God <em>in vain</em>. <a id="c30_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty. <a id="c30_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> <em>There is</em> a generation <em>that</em> curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. <a id="c30_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> <em>There is</em> a generation <em>that are</em> pure in their own eyes, and <em>yet</em> is not washed from their filthiness. <a id="c30_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> <em>There is</em> a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up. <a id="c30_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> <em>There is</em> a generation, whose teeth <em>are as</em> swords, and their jaw teeth <em>as</em> knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from <em>among</em> men. <a id="c30_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The horseleach hath two daughters, <em>crying</em>, Give, give. There are three <em>things that</em> are never satisfied, <em>yea</em>, four <em>things</em> say not, <em>It is</em> enough: <a id="c30_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The grave; and the barren womb; the earth <em>that</em> is not filled with water; and the fire <em>that</em> saith not, <em>It is</em> enough. <a id="c30_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The eye <em>that</em> mocketh at <em>his</em> father, and despiseth to obey <em>his</em> mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it. <a id="c30_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> There be three <em>things which</em> are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not: <a id="c30_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. <a id="c30_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Such <em>is</em> the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. <a id="c30_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For three <em>things</em> the earth is disquieted, and for four <em>which</em> it cannot bear: <a id="c30_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat; <a id="c30_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> For an odious <em>woman</em> when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress. <a id="c30_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> There be four <em>things which are</em> little upon the earth, but they <em>are</em> exceeding wise: <a id="c30_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The ants <em>are</em> a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer; <a id="c30_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> The conies <em>are but</em> a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks; <a id="c30_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; <a id="c30_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces. <a id="c30_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> There be three <em>things</em> which go well, yea, four are comely in going: <a id="c30_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> A lion <em>which is</em> strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any; <a id="c30_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom <em>there is</em> no rising up. <a id="c30_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, <em>lay</em> thine hand upon thy mouth. <a id="c30_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
