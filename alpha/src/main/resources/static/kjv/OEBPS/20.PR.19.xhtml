<h2>Proverbs 19</h2>

<a id="c19_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Better <em>is</em> the poor that walketh in his integrity, than <em>he that is</em> perverse in his lips, and is a fool. <a id="c19_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Also, <em>that</em> the soul <em>be</em> without knowledge, <em>it is</em> not good; and he that hasteth with <em>his</em> feet sinneth. <a id="c19_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD. <a id="c19_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour. <a id="c19_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and <em>he that</em> speaketh lies shall not escape. <a id="c19_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man <em>is</em> a friend to him that giveth gifts. <a id="c19_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth <em>them with</em> words, <em>yet</em> they <em>are</em> wanting <em>to him</em>. <a id="c19_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good. <a id="c19_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and <em>he that</em> speaketh lies shall perish. <a id="c19_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes. <a id="c19_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and <em>it is</em> his glory to pass over a transgression. <a id="c19_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The king's wrath <em>is</em> as the roaring of a lion; but his favour <em>is</em> as dew upon the grass. <a id="c19_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> A foolish son <em>is</em> the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife <em>are</em> a continual dropping. <a id="c19_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> House and riches <em>are</em> the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife <em>is</em> from the LORD. <a id="c19_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger. <a id="c19_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; <em>but</em> he that despiseth his ways shall die. <a id="c19_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again. <a id="c19_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. <a id="c19_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver <em>him</em>, yet thou must do it again. <a id="c19_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. <a id="c19_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> <em>There are</em> many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand. <a id="c19_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> The desire of a man <em>is</em> his kindness: and a poor man <em>is</em> better than a liar. <a id="c19_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The fear of the LORD <em>tendeth</em> to life: and <em>he that hath it</em> shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil. <a id="c19_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> A slothful <em>man</em> hideth his hand in <em>his</em> bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. <a id="c19_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, <em>and</em> he will understand knowledge. <a id="c19_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> He that wasteth <em>his</em> father, <em>and</em> chaseth away <em>his</em> mother, <em>is</em> a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach. <a id="c19_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Cease, my son, to hear the instruction <em>that causeth</em> to err from the words of knowledge. <a id="c19_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. <a id="c19_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
