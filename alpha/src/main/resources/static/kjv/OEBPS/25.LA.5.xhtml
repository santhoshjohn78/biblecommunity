<h2>Lamentations 5</h2>

<a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers <em>are</em> as widows. <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Our necks <em>are</em> under persecution: we labour, <em>and</em> have no rest. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> We have given the hand <em>to</em> the Egyptians, <em>and to</em> the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Our fathers have sinned, <em>and are</em> not; and we have borne their iniquities. <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Servants have ruled over us: <em>there is</em> none that doth deliver <em>us</em> out of their hand. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> We gat our bread with <em>the peril of</em> our lives because of the sword of the wilderness. <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> They ravished the women in Zion, <em>and</em> the maids in the cities of Judah. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured. <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick. <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The crown is fallen <em>from</em> our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned! <a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For this our heart is faint; for these <em>things</em> our eyes are dim. <a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it. <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation. <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, <em>and</em> forsake us so long time? <a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. <a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
