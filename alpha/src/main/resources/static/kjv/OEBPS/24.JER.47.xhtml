<h2>Jeremiah 47</h2>

<a id="c47_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza. <a id="c47_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl. <a id="c47_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong <em>horses</em>, at the rushing of his chariots, <em>and at</em> the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to <em>their</em> children for feebleness of hands; <a id="c47_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, <em>and</em> to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor. <a id="c47_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off <em>with</em> the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself? <a id="c47_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> O thou sword of the LORD, how long <em>will it be</em> ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still. <a id="c47_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.
