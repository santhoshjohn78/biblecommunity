<h2>Psalms 11</h2>

<a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>To the chief Musician, <em>A Psalm</em> of David.</b> In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee <em>as</em> a bird to your mountain? <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For, lo, the wicked bend <em>their</em> bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The LORD <em>is</em> in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne <em>is</em> in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: <em>this shall be</em> the portion of their cup. <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
