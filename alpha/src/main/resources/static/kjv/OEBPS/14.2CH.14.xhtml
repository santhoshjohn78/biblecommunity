<h2>2 Chronicles 14</h2>

<a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years. <a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Asa did <em>that which was</em> good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God: <a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For he took away the altars of the strange <em>gods</em>, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: <a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. <a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. <a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest. <a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about <em>them</em> walls, and towers, gates, and bars, <em>while</em> the land <em>is</em> yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought <em>him</em>, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. <a id="c14_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Asa had an army <em>of men</em> that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these <em>were</em> mighty men of valour. <a id="c14_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah. <a id="c14_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. <a id="c14_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, <em>it is</em> nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou <em>art</em> our God; let not man prevail against thee. <a id="c14_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. <a id="c14_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Asa and the people that <em>were</em> with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil. <a id="c14_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them. <a id="c14_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.
