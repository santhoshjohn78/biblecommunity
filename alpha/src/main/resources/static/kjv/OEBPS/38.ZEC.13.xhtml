<h2>Zechariah 13</h2>

<a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness. <a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, <em>that</em> I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. <a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And it shall come to pass, <em>that</em> when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth. <a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, <em>that</em> the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive: <a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But he shall say, I <em>am</em> no prophet, I <em>am</em> an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth. <a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And <em>one</em> shall say unto him, What <em>are</em> these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, <em>Those</em> with which I was wounded <em>in</em> the house of my friends. <a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man <em>that is</em> my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones. <a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And it shall come to pass, <em>that</em> in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off <em>and</em> die; but the third shall be left therein. <a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It <em>is</em> my people: and they shall say, The LORD <em>is</em> my God.
