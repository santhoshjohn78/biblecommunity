<h2>Proverbs 10</h2>

<a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son <em>is</em> the heaviness of his mother. <a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death. <a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked. <a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He becometh poor that dealeth <em>with</em> a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. <a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He that gathereth in summer <em>is</em> a wise son: <em>but</em> he that sleepeth in harvest <em>is</em> a son that causeth shame. <a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Blessings <em>are</em> upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. <a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The memory of the just <em>is</em> blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot. <a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall. <a id="c10_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known. <a id="c10_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall. <a id="c10_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The mouth of a righteous <em>man is</em> a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. <a id="c10_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins. <a id="c10_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod <em>is</em> for the back of him that is void of understanding. <a id="c10_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Wise <em>men</em> lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish <em>is</em> near destruction. <a id="c10_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The rich man's wealth <em>is</em> his strong city: the destruction of the poor <em>is</em> their poverty. <a id="c10_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The labour of the righteous <em>tendeth</em> to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin. <a id="c10_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He <em>is in</em> the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth. <a id="c10_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> He that hideth hatred <em>with</em> lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, <em>is</em> a fool. <a id="c10_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips <em>is</em> wise. <a id="c10_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> The tongue of the just <em>is as</em> choice silver: the heart of the wicked <em>is</em> little worth. <a id="c10_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom. <a id="c10_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. <a id="c10_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> <em>It is</em> as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom. <a id="c10_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted. <a id="c10_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> As the whirlwind passeth, so <em>is</em> the wicked no <em>more</em>: but the righteous <em>is</em> an everlasting foundation. <a id="c10_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so <em>is</em> the sluggard to them that send him. <a id="c10_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. <a id="c10_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> The hope of the righteous <em>shall be</em> gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish. <a id="c10_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> The way of the LORD <em>is</em> strength to the upright: but destruction <em>shall be</em> to the workers of iniquity. <a id="c10_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth. <a id="c10_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out. <a id="c10_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked <em>speaketh</em> frowardness.
