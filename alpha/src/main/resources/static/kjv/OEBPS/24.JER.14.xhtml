<h2>Jeremiah 14</h2>

<a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth. <a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. <a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, <em>and</em> found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads. <a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads. <a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook <em>it</em>, because there was no grass. <a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because <em>there was</em> no grass. <a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou <em>it</em> for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee. <a id="c14_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man <em>that</em> turneth aside to tarry for a night? <a id="c14_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man <em>that</em> cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, <em>art</em> in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not. <a id="c14_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins. <a id="c14_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for <em>their</em> good. <a id="c14_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence. <a id="c14_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place. <a id="c14_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart. <a id="c14_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed. <a id="c14_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them. <a id="c14_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow. <a id="c14_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not. <a id="c14_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and <em>there is</em> no healing for us? we looked for peace, and <em>there is</em> no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble! <a id="c14_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, <em>and</em> the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee. <a id="c14_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Do not abhor <em>us</em>, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us. <a id="c14_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Are there <em>any</em> among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? <em>art</em> not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these <em>things</em>.
