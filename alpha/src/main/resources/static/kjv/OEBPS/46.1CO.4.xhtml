<h2>1 Corinthians 4</h2>

<a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and <em>to</em> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think <em>of men</em> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For who maketh thee to differ <em>from another</em>? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive <em>it</em>, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received <em>it</em>? <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> We <em>are</em> fools for Christ's sake, but ye <em>are</em> wise in Christ; we <em>are</em> weak, but ye <em>are</em> strong; ye <em>are</em> honourable, but we <em>are</em> despised. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, <em>and are</em> the offscouring of all things unto this day. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn <em>you</em>. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet <em>have ye</em> not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. <a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power. <a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For the kingdom of God <em>is</em> not in word, but in power. <a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and <em>in</em> the spirit of meekness?
