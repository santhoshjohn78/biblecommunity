<h2>1 Timothy 4</h2>

<a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Forbidding to marry, <em>and commanding</em> to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For every creature of God <em>is</em> good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself <em>rather</em> unto godliness. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> This <em>is</em> a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> These things command and teach. <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
