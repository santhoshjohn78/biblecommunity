<h2>2 Chronicles 3</h2>

<a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where <em>the LORD</em> appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he began to build in the second <em>day</em> of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Now these <em>are the things wherein</em> Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure <em>was</em> threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the porch that <em>was</em> in the front <em>of the house</em>, the length <em>of it was</em> according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height <em>was</em> an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold <em>was</em> gold of Parvaim. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he made the most holy house, the length whereof <em>was</em> according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, <em>amounting</em> to six hundred talents. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the weight of the nails <em>was</em> fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold. <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the wings of the cherubims <em>were</em> twenty cubits long: one wing <em>of the one cherub was</em> five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing <em>was likewise</em> five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And <em>one</em> wing of the other cherub <em>was</em> five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing <em>was</em> five cubits <em>also</em>, joining to the wing of the other cherub. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces <em>were</em> inward. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And he made the vail <em>of</em> blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that <em>was</em> on the top of each of them <em>was</em> five cubits. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he made chains, <em>as</em> in the oracle, and put <em>them</em> on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put <em>them</em> on the chains. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
