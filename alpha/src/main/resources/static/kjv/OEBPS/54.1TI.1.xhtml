<h2>1 Timothy 1</h2>

<a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, <em>which is</em> our hope; <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Unto Timothy, <em>my</em> own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, <em>and</em> peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine, <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: <em>so do</em>. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and <em>of</em> a good conscience, and <em>of</em> faith unfeigned: <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But we know that the law <em>is</em> good, if a man use it lawfully; <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine; <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did <em>it</em> ignorantly in unbelief. <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> This <em>is</em> a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, <em>be</em> honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare; <a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: <a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
