<h2>Proverbs 31</h2>

<a id="c31_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him. <a id="c31_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? <a id="c31_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. <a id="c31_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> <em>It is</em> not for kings, O Lemuel, <em>it is</em> not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: <a id="c31_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. <a id="c31_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. <a id="c31_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. <a id="c31_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. <a id="c31_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy. <a id="c31_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price <em>is</em> far above rubies. <a id="c31_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. <a id="c31_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. <a id="c31_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. <a id="c31_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar. <a id="c31_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens. <a id="c31_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. <a id="c31_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. <a id="c31_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> She perceiveth that her merchandise <em>is</em> good: her candle goeth not out by night. <a id="c31_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. <a id="c31_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. <a id="c31_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household <em>are</em> clothed with scarlet. <a id="c31_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing <em>is</em> silk and purple. <a id="c31_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. <a id="c31_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> She maketh fine linen, and selleth <em>it</em>; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. <a id="c31_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Strength and honour <em>are</em> her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. <a id="c31_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue <em>is</em> the law of kindness. <a id="c31_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. <a id="c31_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband <em>also</em>, and he praiseth her. <a id="c31_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. <a id="c31_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Favour <em>is</em> deceitful, and beauty <em>is</em> vain: <em>but</em> a woman <em>that</em> feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. <a id="c31_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
