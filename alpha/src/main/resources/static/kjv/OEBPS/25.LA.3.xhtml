<h2>Lamentations 3</h2>

<a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I <em>am</em> the man <em>that</em> hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> He hath led me, and brought <em>me into</em> darkness, but not <em>into</em> light. <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand <em>against me</em> all the day. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He hath builded against me, and compassed <em>me</em> with gall and travail. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He hath set me in dark places, as <em>they that be</em> dead of old. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> He <em>was</em> unto me <em>as</em> a bear lying in wait, <em>and as</em> a lion in secret places. <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I was a derision to all my people; <em>and</em> their song all the day. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD: <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> My soul hath <em>them</em> still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. <a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> <em>It is of</em> the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. <a id="c3_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> <em>They are</em> new every morning: great <em>is</em> thy faithfulness. <a id="c3_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The LORD <em>is</em> my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. <a id="c3_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The LORD <em>is</em> good unto them that wait for him, to the soul <em>that</em> seeketh him. <a id="c3_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> <em>It is</em> good that <em>a man</em> should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD. <a id="c3_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> <em>It is</em> good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. <a id="c3_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne <em>it</em> upon him. <a id="c3_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. <a id="c3_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> He giveth <em>his</em> cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach. <a id="c3_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> For the Lord will not cast off for ever: <a id="c3_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. <a id="c3_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. <a id="c3_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, <a id="c3_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, <a id="c3_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. <a id="c3_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> Who <em>is</em> he <em>that</em> saith, and it cometh to pass, <em>when</em> the Lord commandeth <em>it</em> not? <a id="c3_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? <a id="c3_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? <a id="c3_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD. <a id="c3_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> Let us lift up our heart with <em>our</em> hands unto God in the heavens. <a id="c3_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. <a id="c3_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. <a id="c3_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that <em>our</em> prayer should not pass through. <a id="c3_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> Thou hast made us <em>as</em> the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. <a id="c3_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. <a id="c3_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. <a id="c3_v48"></a><span class="vn">48</span> Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. <a id="c3_v49"></a><span class="vn">49</span> Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, <a id="c3_v50"></a><span class="vn">50</span> Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. <a id="c3_v51"></a><span class="vn">51</span> Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. <a id="c3_v52"></a><span class="vn">52</span> Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. <a id="c3_v53"></a><span class="vn">53</span> They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. <a id="c3_v54"></a><span class="vn">54</span> Waters flowed over mine head; <em>then</em> I said, I am cut off. <a id="c3_v55"></a><span class="vn">55</span> I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon. <a id="c3_v56"></a><span class="vn">56</span> Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. <a id="c3_v57"></a><span class="vn">57</span> Thou drewest near in the day <em>that</em> I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. <a id="c3_v58"></a><span class="vn">58</span> O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. <a id="c3_v59"></a><span class="vn">59</span> O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. <a id="c3_v60"></a><span class="vn">60</span> Thou hast seen all their vengeance <em>and</em> all their imaginations against me. <a id="c3_v61"></a><span class="vn">61</span> Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, <em>and</em> all their imaginations against me; <a id="c3_v62"></a><span class="vn">62</span> The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day. <a id="c3_v63"></a><span class="vn">63</span> Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I <em>am</em> their musick. <a id="c3_v64"></a><span class="vn">64</span> Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands. <a id="c3_v65"></a><span class="vn">65</span> Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. <a id="c3_v66"></a><span class="vn">66</span> Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.
