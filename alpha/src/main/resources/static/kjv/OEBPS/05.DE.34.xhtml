<h2>Deuteronomy 34</h2>

<a id="c34_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that <em>is</em> over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, <a id="c34_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, <a id="c34_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar. <a id="c34_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the LORD said unto him, This <em>is</em> the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see <em>it</em> with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither. <a id="c34_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD. <a id="c34_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. <a id="c34_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Moses <em>was</em> an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. <a id="c34_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping <em>and</em> mourning for Moses were ended. <a id="c34_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses. <a id="c34_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, <a id="c34_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, <a id="c34_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.
