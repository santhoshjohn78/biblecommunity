<h2>Revelation 9</h2>

<a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. <a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. <a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. <a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. <a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment <em>was</em> as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. <a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. <a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the shapes of the locusts <em>were</em> like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads <em>were</em> as it were crowns like gold, and their faces <em>were</em> as the faces of men. <a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as <em>the teeth</em> of lions. <a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings <em>was</em> as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. <a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power <em>was</em> to hurt men five months. <a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And they had a king over them, <em>which is</em> the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue <em>is</em> Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath <em>his</em> name Apollyon. <a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> One woe is past; <em>and</em>, behold, there come two woes more hereafter. <a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, <a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. <a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men. <a id="c9_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the number of the army of the horsemen <em>were</em> two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them. <a id="c9_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses <em>were</em> as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone. <a id="c9_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. <a id="c9_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails <em>were</em> like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. <a id="c9_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: <a id="c9_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
