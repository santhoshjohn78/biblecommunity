<h2>Psalms 8</h2>

<a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David.</b> O LORD our Lord, how excellent <em>is</em> thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. <a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all <em>things</em> under his feet: <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, <em>and whatsoever</em> passeth through the paths of the seas. <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> O LORD our Lord, how excellent <em>is</em> thy name in all the earth!
