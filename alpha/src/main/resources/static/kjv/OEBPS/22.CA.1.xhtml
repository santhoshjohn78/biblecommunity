<h2>Song of Solomon 1</h2>

<a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The song of songs, which <em>is</em> Solomon's. <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love <em>is</em> better than wine. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name <em>is as</em> ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee. <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I <em>am</em> black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Look not upon me, because I <em>am</em> black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; <em>but</em> mine own vineyard have I not kept. <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest <em>thy flock</em> to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents. <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots. <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Thy cheeks are comely with rows <em>of jewels</em>, thy neck with chains <em>of gold</em>. <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> While the king <em>sitteth</em> at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof. <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> A bundle of myrrh <em>is</em> my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts. <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> My beloved <em>is</em> unto me <em>as</em> a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Behold, thou <em>art</em> fair, my love; behold, thou <em>art</em> fair; thou <em>hast</em> doves' eyes. <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Behold, thou <em>art</em> fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed <em>is</em> green. <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The beams of our house <em>are</em> cedar, <em>and</em> our rafters of fir.
