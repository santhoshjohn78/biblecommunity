<h2>Leviticus 12</h2>

<a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest: <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This <em>is</em> the law for her that hath born a male or a female. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
