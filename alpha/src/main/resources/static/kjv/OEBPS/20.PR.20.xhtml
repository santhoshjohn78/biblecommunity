<h2>Proverbs 20</h2>

<a id="c20_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Wine <em>is</em> a mocker, strong drink <em>is</em> raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. <a id="c20_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The fear of a king <em>is</em> as the roaring of a lion: <em>whoso</em> provoketh him to anger sinneth <em>against</em> his own soul. <a id="c20_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> <em>It is</em> an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling. <a id="c20_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; <em>therefore</em> shall he beg in harvest, and <em>have</em> nothing. <a id="c20_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Counsel in the heart of man <em>is like</em> deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out. <a id="c20_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find? <a id="c20_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The just <em>man</em> walketh in his integrity: his children <em>are</em> blessed after him. <a id="c20_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes. <a id="c20_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? <a id="c20_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Divers weights, <em>and</em> divers measures, both of them <em>are</em> alike abomination to the LORD. <a id="c20_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work <em>be</em> pure, and whether <em>it be</em> right. <a id="c20_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them. <a id="c20_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, <em>and</em> thou shalt be satisfied with bread. <a id="c20_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> <em>It is</em> naught, <em>it is</em> naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. <a id="c20_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge <em>are</em> a precious jewel. <a id="c20_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Take his garment that is surety <em>for</em> a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. <a id="c20_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Bread of deceit <em>is</em> sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. <a id="c20_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> <em>Every</em> purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war. <a id="c20_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> He that goeth about <em>as</em> a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips. <a id="c20_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness. <a id="c20_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> An inheritance <em>may be</em> gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed. <a id="c20_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Say not thou, I will recompense evil; <em>but</em> wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee. <a id="c20_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Divers weights <em>are</em> an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance <em>is</em> not good. <a id="c20_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Man's goings <em>are</em> of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way? <a id="c20_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> <em>It is</em> a snare to the man <em>who</em> devoureth <em>that which is</em> holy, and after vows to make enquiry. <a id="c20_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them. <a id="c20_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The spirit of man <em>is</em> the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly. <a id="c20_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy. <a id="c20_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> The glory of young men <em>is</em> their strength: and the beauty of old men <em>is</em> the gray head. <a id="c20_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so <em>do</em> stripes the inward parts of the belly.
