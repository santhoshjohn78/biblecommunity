<h2>1 Timothy 2</h2>

<a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, <em>and</em> giving of thanks, be made for all men; <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For kings, and <em>for</em> all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For this <em>is</em> good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For <em>there is</em> one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, <em>and</em> lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For Adam was first formed, then Eve. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
