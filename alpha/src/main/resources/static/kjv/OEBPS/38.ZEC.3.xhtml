<h2>Zechariah 3</h2>

<a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: <em>is</em> not this a brand plucked out of the fire? <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying, <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they <em>are</em> men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone <em>shall be</em> seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.
