<h2>Ephesians 6</h2>

<a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;) <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Servants, be obedient to them that are <em>your</em> masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether <em>he be</em> bond or free. <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him. <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high <em>places</em>. <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. <a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; <a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; <a id="c6_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. <a id="c6_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: <a id="c6_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; <a id="c6_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, <a id="c6_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. <a id="c6_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> But that ye also may know my affairs, <em>and</em> how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: <a id="c6_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and <em>that</em> he might comfort your hearts. <a id="c6_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Peace <em>be</em> to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <a id="c6_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Grace <em>be</em> with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.<blue> To <em>the</em> Ephesians written from Rome, by Tychicus.</blue>
