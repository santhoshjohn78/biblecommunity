<h2>Psalms 98</h2>

<a id="c98_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Psalm.</b> O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. <a id="c98_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen. <a id="c98_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. <a id="c98_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. <a id="c98_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm. <a id="c98_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King. <a id="c98_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. <a id="c98_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Let the floods clap <em>their</em> hands: let the hills be joyful together <a id="c98_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.
