<h2>Psalms 12</h2>

<a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.</b> Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: <em>with</em> flattering lips <em>and</em> with a double heart do they speak. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, <em>and</em> the tongue that speaketh proud things: <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips <em>are</em> our own: who <em>is</em> lord over us? <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set <em>him</em> in safety <em>from him that</em> puffeth at him. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The words of the LORD <em>are</em> pure words: <em>as</em> silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
