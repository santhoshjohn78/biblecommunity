<h2>Psalms 99</h2>

<a id="c99_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth <em>between</em> the cherubims; let the earth be moved. <a id="c99_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The LORD <em>is</em> great in Zion; and he <em>is</em> high above all the people. <a id="c99_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Let them praise thy great and terrible name; <em>for</em> it <em>is</em> holy. <a id="c99_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. <a id="c99_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; <em>for</em> he <em>is</em> holy. <a id="c99_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. <a id="c99_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance <em>that</em> he gave them. <a id="c99_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. <a id="c99_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God <em>is</em> holy.
