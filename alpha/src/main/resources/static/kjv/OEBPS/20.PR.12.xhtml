<h2>Proverbs 12</h2>

<a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof <em>is</em> brutish. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> A good <em>man</em> obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved. <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> A virtuous woman <em>is</em> a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed <em>is</em> as rottenness in his bones. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The thoughts of the righteous <em>are</em> right: <em>but</em> the counsels of the wicked <em>are</em> deceit. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The words of the wicked <em>are</em> to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The wicked are overthrown, and <em>are</em> not: but the house of the righteous shall stand. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised. <a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> <em>He that is</em> despised, and hath a servant, <em>is</em> better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread. <a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> A righteous <em>man</em> regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked <em>are</em> cruel. <a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain <em>persons is</em> void of understanding. <a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The wicked desireth the net of evil <em>men</em>: but the root of the righteous yieldeth <em>fruit</em>. <a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The wicked is snared by the transgression of <em>his</em> lips: but the just shall come out of trouble. <a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of <em>his</em> mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him. <a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The way of a fool <em>is</em> right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel <em>is</em> wise. <a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent <em>man</em> covereth shame. <a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> <em>He that</em> speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit. <a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise <em>is</em> health. <a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue <em>is</em> but for a moment. <a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Deceit <em>is</em> in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace <em>is</em> joy. <a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief. <a id="c12_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Lying lips <em>are</em> abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly <em>are</em> his delight. <a id="c12_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness. <a id="c12_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute. <a id="c12_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad. <a id="c12_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> The righteous <em>is</em> more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them. <a id="c12_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The slothful <em>man</em> roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man <em>is</em> precious. <a id="c12_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> In the way of righteousness <em>is</em> life; and <em>in</em> the pathway <em>thereof there is</em> no death.
