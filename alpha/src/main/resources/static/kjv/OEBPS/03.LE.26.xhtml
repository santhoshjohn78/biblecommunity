<h2>Leviticus 26</h2>

<a id="c26_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up <em>any</em> image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I <em>am</em> the LORD your God. <a id="c26_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I <em>am</em> the LORD. <a id="c26_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; <a id="c26_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. <a id="c26_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. <a id="c26_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make <em>you</em> afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. <a id="c26_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. <a id="c26_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. <a id="c26_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you. <a id="c26_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new. <a id="c26_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. <a id="c26_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people. <a id="c26_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I <em>am</em> the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright. <a id="c26_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; <a id="c26_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, <em>but</em> that ye break my covenant: <a id="c26_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. <a id="c26_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. <a id="c26_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins. <a id="c26_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: <a id="c26_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits. <a id="c26_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. <a id="c26_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your <em>high</em> ways shall be desolate. <a id="c26_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me; <a id="c26_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins. <a id="c26_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of <em>my</em> covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. <a id="c26_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> <em>And</em> when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver <em>you</em> your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. <a id="c26_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; <a id="c26_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins. <a id="c26_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. <a id="c26_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. <a id="c26_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. <a id="c26_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it. <a id="c26_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. <a id="c26_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye <em>be</em> in your enemies' land; <em>even</em> then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. <a id="c26_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. <a id="c26_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And upon them that are left <em>alive</em> of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. <a id="c26_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. <a id="c26_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. <a id="c26_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. <a id="c26_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me; <a id="c26_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And <em>that</em> I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: <a id="c26_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. <a id="c26_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes. <a id="c26_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I <em>am</em> the LORD their God. <a id="c26_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I <em>am</em> the LORD. <a id="c26_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> These <em>are</em> the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
