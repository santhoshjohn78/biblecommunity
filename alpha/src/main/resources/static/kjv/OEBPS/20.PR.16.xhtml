<h2>Proverbs 16</h2>

<a id="c16_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, <em>is</em> from the LORD. <a id="c16_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> All the ways of a man <em>are</em> clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits. <a id="c16_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established. <a id="c16_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The LORD hath made all <em>things</em> for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. <a id="c16_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Every one <em>that is</em> proud in heart <em>is</em> an abomination to the LORD: <em>though</em> hand <em>join</em> in hand, he shall not be unpunished. <a id="c16_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD <em>men</em> depart from evil. <a id="c16_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. <a id="c16_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Better <em>is</em> a little with righteousness than great revenues without right. <a id="c16_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps. <a id="c16_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> A divine sentence <em>is</em> in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment. <a id="c16_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> A just weight and balance <em>are</em> the LORD'S: all the weights of the bag <em>are</em> his work. <a id="c16_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> <em>It is</em> an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness. <a id="c16_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Righteous lips <em>are</em> the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right. <a id="c16_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The wrath of a king <em>is as</em> messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it. <a id="c16_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> In the light of the king's countenance <em>is</em> life; and his favour <em>is</em> as a cloud of the latter rain. <a id="c16_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> How much better <em>is it</em> to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver! <a id="c16_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The highway of the upright <em>is</em> to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. <a id="c16_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Pride <em>goeth</em> before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. <a id="c16_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Better <em>it is to be</em> of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud. <a id="c16_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy <em>is</em> he. <a id="c16_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. <a id="c16_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Understanding <em>is</em> a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools <em>is</em> folly. <a id="c16_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips. <a id="c16_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Pleasant words <em>are as</em> an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. <a id="c16_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof <em>are</em> the ways of death. <a id="c16_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him. <a id="c16_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips <em>there is</em> as a burning fire. <a id="c16_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends. <a id="c16_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way <em>that is</em> not good. <a id="c16_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass. <a id="c16_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> The hoary head <em>is</em> a crown of glory, <em>if</em> it be found in the way of righteousness. <a id="c16_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> <em>He that is</em> slow to anger <em>is</em> better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. <a id="c16_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof <em>is</em> of the LORD.
