<h2>Proverbs 17</h2>

<a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Better <em>is</em> a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices <em>with</em> strife. <a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren. <a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The fining pot <em>is</em> for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts. <a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; <em>and</em> a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue. <a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: <em>and</em> he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished. <a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Children's children <em>are</em> the crown of old men; and the glory of children <em>are</em> their fathers. <a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince. <a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> A gift <em>is as</em> a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. <a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth <em>very</em> friends. <a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool. <a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> An evil <em>man</em> seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. <a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly. <a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. <a id="c17_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The beginning of strife <em>is as</em> when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with. <a id="c17_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both <em>are</em> abomination to the LORD. <a id="c17_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Wherefore <em>is there</em> a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing <em>he hath</em> no heart <em>to it</em>? <a id="c17_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. <a id="c17_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> A man void of understanding striketh hands, <em>and</em> becometh surety in the presence of his friend. <a id="c17_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> He loveth transgression that loveth strife: <em>and</em> he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction. <a id="c17_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. <a id="c17_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> He that begetteth a fool <em>doeth it</em> to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy. <a id="c17_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> A merry heart doeth good <em>like</em> a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones. <a id="c17_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> A wicked <em>man</em> taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment. <a id="c17_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Wisdom <em>is</em> before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool <em>are</em> in the ends of the earth. <a id="c17_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> A foolish son <em>is</em> a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him. <a id="c17_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Also to punish the just <em>is</em> not good, <em>nor</em> to strike princes for equity. <a id="c17_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> He that hath knowledge spareth his words: <em>and</em> a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit. <a id="c17_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: <em>and</em> he that shutteth his lips <em>is esteemed</em> a man of understanding.
