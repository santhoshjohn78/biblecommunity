<h2>Zechariah 9</h2>

<a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus <em>shall be</em> the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, <em>shall be</em> toward the LORD. <a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise. <a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. <a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. <a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Ashkelon shall see <em>it</em>, and fear; Gaza also <em>shall see it</em>, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. <a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. <a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, <em>shall be</em> for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite. <a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes. <a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he <em>is</em> just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass. <a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion <em>shall be</em> from sea <em>even</em> to sea, and from the river <em>even</em> to the ends of the earth. <a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein <em>is</em> no water. <a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare <em>that</em> I will render double unto thee; <a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man. <a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord GOD shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south. <a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, <em>and</em> make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, <em>and</em> as the corners of the altar. <a id="c9_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they <em>shall be as</em> the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land. <a id="c9_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For how great <em>is</em> his goodness, and how great <em>is</em> his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.
