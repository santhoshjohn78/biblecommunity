<h2>Deuteronomy 3</h2>

<a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> All these cities <em>were</em> fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that <em>was</em> on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon; <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> (<em>Which</em> Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;) <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead <em>was</em> a bedstead of iron; <em>is</em> it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits <em>was</em> the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And this land, <em>which</em> we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which <em>is</em> by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, <em>being</em> the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And I gave Gilead unto Machir. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, <em>which is</em> the border of the children of Ammon; <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast <em>thereof</em>, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, <em>even</em> the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all <em>that are</em> meet for the war. <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (<em>for</em> I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you; <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and <em>until</em> they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and <em>then</em> shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you. <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. <a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you. <a id="c3_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, <a id="c3_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God <em>is there</em> in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might? <a id="c3_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that <em>is</em> beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. <a id="c3_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter. <a id="c3_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold <em>it</em> with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. <a id="c3_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see. <a id="c3_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.
