<h2>Psalms 61</h2>

<a id="c61_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>To the chief Musician upon Neginah, <em>A Psalm</em> of David.</b> Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. <a id="c61_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock <em>that</em> is higher than I. <a id="c61_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For thou hast been a shelter for me, <em>and</em> a strong tower from the enemy. <a id="c61_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. <a id="c61_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given <em>me</em> the heritage of those that fear thy name. <a id="c61_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thou wilt prolong the king's life: <em>and</em> his years as many generations. <a id="c61_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, <em>which</em> may preserve him. <a id="c61_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
