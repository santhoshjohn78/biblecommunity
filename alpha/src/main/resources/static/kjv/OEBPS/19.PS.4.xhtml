<h2>Psalms 4</h2>

<a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David.</b> Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me <em>when I was</em> in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> O ye sons of men, how long <em>will ye turn</em> my glory into shame? <em>how long</em> will ye love vanity, <em>and</em> seek after leasing? Selah. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> <em>There be</em> many that say, Who will shew us <em>any</em> good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time <em>that</em> their corn and their wine increased. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.
