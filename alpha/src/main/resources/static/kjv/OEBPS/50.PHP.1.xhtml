<h2>Philippians 1</h2>

<a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Grace <em>be</em> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <em>from</em> the Lord Jesus Christ. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform <em>it</em> until the day of Jesus Christ: <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and <em>in</em> all judgment; <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things <em>which happened</em> unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other <em>places</em>; <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. <a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, <a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> According to my earnest expectation and <em>my</em> hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but <em>that</em> with all boldness, as always, <em>so</em> now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether <em>it be</em> by life, or by death. <a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For to me to live <em>is</em> Christ, and to die <em>is</em> gain. <a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But if I live in the flesh, this <em>is</em> the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not. <a id="c1_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: <a id="c1_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Nevertheless to abide in the flesh <em>is</em> more needful for you. <a id="c1_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; <a id="c1_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again. <a id="c1_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; <a id="c1_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. <a id="c1_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; <a id="c1_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear <em>to be</em> in me.
