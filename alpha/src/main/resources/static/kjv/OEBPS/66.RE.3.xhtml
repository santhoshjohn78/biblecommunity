<h2>Revelation 3</h2>

<a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth; <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, <em>which is</em> new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and <em>I will write upon him</em> my new name. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God; <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and <em>that</em> the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. <a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
