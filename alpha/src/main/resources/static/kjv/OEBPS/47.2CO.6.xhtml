<h2>2 Corinthians 6</h2>

<a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> We then, <em>as</em> workers together <em>with him</em>, beseech <em>you</em> also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now <em>is</em> the accepted time; behold, now <em>is</em> the day of salvation.) <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> But in all <em>things</em> approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and <em>yet</em> true; <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> As unknown, and <em>yet</em> well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and <em>yet</em> possessing all things. <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> O <em>ye</em> Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged. <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels. <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto <em>my</em> children,) be ye also enlarged. <a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? <a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? <a id="c6_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in <em>them</em>; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. <a id="c6_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean <em>thing</em>; and I will receive you, <a id="c6_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
