<h2>Psalms 14</h2>

<a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>To the chief Musician, <em>A Psalm</em> of David.</b> The fool hath said in his heart, <em>There is</em> no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, <em>there is</em> none that doeth good. <a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, <em>and</em> seek God. <a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> They are all gone aside, they are <em>all</em> together become filthy: <em>there is</em> none that doeth good, no, not one. <a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people <em>as</em> they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD. <a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> There were they in great fear: for God <em>is</em> in the generation of the righteous. <a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD <em>is</em> his refuge. <a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Oh that the salvation of Israel <em>were come</em> out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, <em>and</em> Israel shall be glad.
