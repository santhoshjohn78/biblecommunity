<h2>Psalms 111</h2>

<a id="c111_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with <em>my</em> whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and <em>in</em> the congregation. <a id="c111_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The works of the LORD <em>are</em> great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. <a id="c111_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> His work <em>is</em> honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever. <a id="c111_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD <em>is</em> gracious and full of compassion. <a id="c111_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant. <a id="c111_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen. <a id="c111_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The works of his hands <em>are</em> verity and judgment; all his commandments <em>are</em> sure. <a id="c111_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> They stand fast for ever and ever, <em>and are</em> done in truth and uprightness. <a id="c111_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend <em>is</em> his name. <a id="c111_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The fear of the LORD <em>is</em> the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do <em>his commandments</em>: his praise endureth for ever.
