<h2>1 Corinthians 5</h2>

<a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> It is reported commonly <em>that there is</em> fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, <em>concerning</em> him that hath so done this deed, <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Your glorying <em>is</em> not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened <em>bread</em> of sincerity and truth. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
