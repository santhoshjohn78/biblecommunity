<h2>Zechariah 2</h2>

<a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what <em>is</em> the breadth thereof, and what <em>is</em> the length thereof. <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited <em>as</em> towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein: <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Ho, ho, <em>come forth</em>, and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest <em>with</em> the daughter of Babylon. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again. <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.
