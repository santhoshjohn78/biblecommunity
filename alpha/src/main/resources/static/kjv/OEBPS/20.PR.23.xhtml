<h2>Proverbs 23</h2>

<a id="c23_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what<em> is</em> before thee: <a id="c23_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And put a knife to thy throat, if thou<em> be</em> a man given to appetite. <a id="c23_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Be not desirous of his dainties: for they<em> are</em> deceitful meat. <a id="c23_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom. <a id="c23_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for<em> riches</em> certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven. <a id="c23_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Eat thou not the bread of<em> him that hath</em> an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats: <a id="c23_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For as he thinketh in his heart, so<em> is</em> he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart<em> is</em> not with thee. <a id="c23_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The morsel<em> which</em> thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words. <a id="c23_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words. <a id="c23_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: <a id="c23_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For their redeemer<em> is</em> mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee. <a id="c23_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge. <a id="c23_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Withhold not correction from the child: for<em> if</em> thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. <a id="c23_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell. <a id="c23_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine. <a id="c23_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things. <a id="c23_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Let not thine heart envy sinners: but<em> be thou</em> in the fear of the LORD all the day long. <a id="c23_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off. <a id="c23_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. <a id="c23_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: <a id="c23_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe<em> a man</em> with rags. <a id="c23_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old. <a id="c23_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Buy the truth, and sell<em> it</em> not;<em> also</em> wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. <a id="c23_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise<em> child</em> shall have joy of him. <a id="c23_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice. <a id="c23_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways. <a id="c23_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> For a whore<em> is</em> a deep ditch; and a strange woman<em> is</em> a narrow pit. <a id="c23_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> She also lieth in wait as<em> for</em> a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men. <a id="c23_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? <a id="c23_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. <a id="c23_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup,<em> when</em> it moveth itself aright. <a id="c23_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. <a id="c23_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things. <a id="c23_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. <a id="c23_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> They have stricken me,<em> shalt thou say, and</em> I was not sick; they have beaten me,<em> and</em> I felt<em> it</em> not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
