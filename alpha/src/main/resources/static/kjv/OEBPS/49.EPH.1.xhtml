<h2>Ephesians 1</h2>

<a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Grace <em>be</em> to you, and peace, from God our Father, and <em>from</em> the Lord Jesus Christ. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Blessed <em>be</em> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly <em>places</em> in Christ: <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; <em>even</em> in him: <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> In whom ye also <em>trusted</em>, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, <a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And what <em>is</em> the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, <a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set <em>him</em> at his own right hand in the heavenly <em>places</em>, <a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: <a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And hath put all <em>things</em> under his feet, and gave him <em>to be</em> the head over all <em>things</em> to the church, <a id="c1_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
