<h2>1 Chronicles 13</h2>

<a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, <em>and</em> with every leader. <a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If <em>it seem</em> good unto you, and <em>that it be</em> of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, <em>that are</em> left in all the land of Israel, and with them <em>also</em> to the priests and Levites <em>which are</em> in their cities <em>and</em> suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us: <a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul. <a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. <a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim. <a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, <em>that is</em>, to Kirjathjearim, which <em>belonged</em> to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth <em>between</em> the cherubims, whose name is called <em>on it</em>. <a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart. <a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And David and all Israel played before God with all <em>their</em> might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. <a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. <a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God. <a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day. <a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God <em>home</em> to me? <a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> So David brought not the ark <em>home</em> to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. <a id="c13_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.
