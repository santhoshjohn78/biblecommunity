<h2>Psalms 133</h2>

<a id="c133_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Song of degrees of David.</b> Behold, how good and how pleasant <em>it is</em> for brethren to dwell together in unity! <a id="c133_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> <em>It is</em> like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, <em>even</em> Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; <a id="c133_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> As the dew of Hermon, <em>and as the dew</em> that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, <em>even</em> life for evermore.
