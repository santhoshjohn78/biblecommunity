<h2>Colossians 4</h2>

<a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Masters, give unto <em>your</em> servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds: <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let your speech <em>be</em> alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, <em>who is</em> a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts; <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is <em>one</em> of you. They shall make known unto you all things which <em>are done</em> here. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;) <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only <em>are my</em> fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me. <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Epaphras, who is <em>one</em> of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them <em>that are</em> in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the <em>epistle</em> from Laodicea. <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it. <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace <em>be</em> with you. Amen.<blue> Written from Rome to Colossians by Tychicus and Onesimus.</blue>
