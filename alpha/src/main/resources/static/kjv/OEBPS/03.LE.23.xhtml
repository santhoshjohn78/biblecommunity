and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days. <a id="c23_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. <em>It shall be</em> a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month. <a id="c23_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths: <a id="c23_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I <em>am</em> the LORD your God. <a id="c23_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.
