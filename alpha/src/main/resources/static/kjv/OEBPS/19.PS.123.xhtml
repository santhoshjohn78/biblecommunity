<h2>Psalms 123</h2>

<a id="c123_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Song of degrees.</b> Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. <a id="c123_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Behold, as the eyes of servants <em>look</em> unto the hand of their masters, <em>and</em> as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes <em>wait</em> upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us. <a id="c123_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. <a id="c123_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, <em>and</em> with the contempt of the proud.
