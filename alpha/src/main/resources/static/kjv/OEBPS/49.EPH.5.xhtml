<h2>Ephesians 5</h2>

<a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Be not ye therefore partakers with them. <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For ye were sometimes darkness, but now <em>are ye</em> light in the Lord: walk as children of light: <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> (For the fruit of the Spirit <em>is</em> in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove <em>them</em>. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. <a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord <em>is</em>. <a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; <a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. <a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. <a id="c5_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. <a id="c5_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so <em>let</em> the wives <em>be</em> to their own husbands in every thing. <a id="c5_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; <a id="c5_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, <a id="c5_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. <a id="c5_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. <a id="c5_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: <a id="c5_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. <a id="c5_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. <a id="c5_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. <a id="c5_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife <em>see</em> that she reverence <em>her</em> husband.
