<h2>Joshua 15</h2>

<a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <em>This</em> then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; <em>even</em> to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward <em>was</em> the uttermost part of the south coast. <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward: <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa: <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> <em>From thence</em> it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast. <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the east border <em>was</em> the salt sea, <em>even</em> unto the end of Jordan. And <em>their</em> border in the north quarter <em>was</em> from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan: <a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben: <a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that <em>is</em> before the going up to Adummim, which <em>is</em> on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel: <a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same <em>is</em> Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that <em>lieth</em> before the valley of Hinnom westward, which <em>is</em> at the end of the valley of the giants northward: <a id="c15_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which <em>is</em> Kirjathjearim: <a id="c15_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which <em>is</em> Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah: <a id="c15_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea. <a id="c15_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the west border <em>was</em> to the great sea, and the coast <em>thereof</em>. This <em>is</em> the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families. <a id="c15_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, <em>even</em> the city of Arba the father of Anak, which <em>city is</em> Hebron. <a id="c15_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. <a id="c15_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before <em>was</em> Kirjathsepher. <a id="c15_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. <a id="c15_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. <a id="c15_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And it came to pass, as she came <em>unto him</em>, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off <em>her</em> ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou? <a id="c15_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs. <a id="c15_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> This <em>is</em> the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families. <a id="c15_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur, <a id="c15_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah, <a id="c15_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan, <a id="c15_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth, <a id="c15_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, <em>and</em> Hezron, which <em>is</em> Hazor, <a id="c15_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Amam, and Shema, and Moladah, <a id="c15_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet, <a id="c15_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah, <a id="c15_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Baalah, and Iim, and Azem, <a id="c15_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah, <a id="c15_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah, <a id="c15_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities <em>are</em> twenty and nine, with their villages: <a id="c15_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> <em>And</em> in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah, <a id="c15_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam, <a id="c15_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah, <a id="c15_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages: <a id="c15_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad, <a id="c15_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel, <a id="c15_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon, <a id="c15_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish, <a id="c15_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages: <a id="c15_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan, <a id="c15_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib, <a id="c15_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages: <a id="c15_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> Ekron, with her towns and her villages: <a id="c15_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> From Ekron even unto the sea, all that <em>lay</em> near Ashdod, with their villages: <a id="c15_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border <em>thereof</em>: <a id="c15_v48"></a><span class="vn">48</span> And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh, <a id="c15_v49"></a><span class="vn">49</span> And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah, which <em>is</em> Debir, <a id="c15_v50"></a><span class="vn">50</span> And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim, <a id="c15_v51"></a><span class="vn">51</span> And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages: <a id="c15_v52"></a><span class="vn">52</span> Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean, <a id="c15_v53"></a><span class="vn">53</span> And Janum, and Bethtappuah, and Aphekah, <a id="c15_v54"></a><span class="vn">54</span> And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which <em>is</em> Hebron, and Zior; nine cities with their villages: <a id="c15_v55"></a><span class="vn">55</span> Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah, <a id="c15_v56"></a><span class="vn">56</span> And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah, <a id="c15_v57"></a><span class="vn">57</span> Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages: <a id="c15_v58"></a><span class="vn">58</span> Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor, <a id="c15_v59"></a><span class="vn">59</span> And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages: <a id="c15_v60"></a><span class="vn">60</span> Kirjathbaal, which <em>is</em> Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages: <a id="c15_v61"></a><span class="vn">61</span> In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah, <a id="c15_v62"></a><span class="vn">62</span> And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with their villages. <a id="c15_v63"></a><span class="vn">63</span> As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.
