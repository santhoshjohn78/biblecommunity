<h2>Proverbs 18</h2>

<a id="c18_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh <em>and</em> intermeddleth with all wisdom. <a id="c18_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself. <a id="c18_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> When the wicked cometh, <em>then</em> cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach. <a id="c18_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The words of a man's mouth <em>are as</em> deep waters, <em>and</em> the wellspring of wisdom <em>as</em> a flowing brook. <a id="c18_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> <em>It is</em> not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment. <a id="c18_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes. <a id="c18_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> A fool's mouth <em>is</em> his destruction, and his lips <em>are</em> the snare of his soul. <a id="c18_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The words of a talebearer <em>are</em> as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. <a id="c18_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster. <a id="c18_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The name of the LORD <em>is</em> a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. <a id="c18_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The rich man's wealth <em>is</em> his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit. <a id="c18_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour <em>is</em> humility. <a id="c18_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He that answereth a matter before he heareth <em>it</em>, it <em>is</em> folly and shame unto him. <a id="c18_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear? <a id="c18_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. <a id="c18_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men. <a id="c18_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> <em>He that is</em> first in his own cause <em>seemeth</em> just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. <a id="c18_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty. <a id="c18_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> A brother offended <em>is harder to be won</em> than a strong city: and <em>their</em> contentions <em>are</em> like the bars of a castle. <a id="c18_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; <em>and</em> with the increase of his lips shall he be filled. <a id="c18_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Death and life <em>are</em> in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. <a id="c18_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> <em>Whoso</em> findeth a wife findeth a good <em>thing</em>, and obtaineth favour of the LORD. <a id="c18_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly. <a id="c18_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> A man <em>that hath</em> friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend <em>that</em> sticketh closer than a brother.
