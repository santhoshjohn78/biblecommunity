<h2>Psalms 82</h2>

<a id="c82_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Psalm of Asaph.</b> God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. <a id="c82_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. <a id="c82_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. <a id="c82_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Deliver the poor and needy: rid <em>them</em> out of the hand of the wicked. <a id="c82_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. <a id="c82_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I have said, Ye <em>are</em> gods; and all of you <em>are</em> children of the most High. <a id="c82_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. <a id="c82_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
