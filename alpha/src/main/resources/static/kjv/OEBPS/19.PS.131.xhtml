<h2>Psalms 131</h2>

<a id="c131_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Song of degrees of David.</b> LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. <a id="c131_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul <em>is</em> even as a weaned child. <a id="c131_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
