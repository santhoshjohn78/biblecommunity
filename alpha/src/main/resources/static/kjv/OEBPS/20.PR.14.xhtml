<h2>Proverbs 14</h2>

<a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands. <a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but <em>he that is</em> perverse in his ways despiseth him. <a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> In the mouth of the foolish <em>is</em> a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them. <a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Where no oxen <em>are</em>, the crib <em>is</em> clean: but much increase <em>is</em> by the strength of the ox. <a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies. <a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> A scorner seeketh wisdom, and <em>findeth it</em> not: but knowledge <em>is</em> easy unto him that understandeth. <a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not <em>in him</em> the lips of knowledge. <a id="c14_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The wisdom of the prudent <em>is</em> to understand his way: but the folly of fools <em>is</em> deceit. <a id="c14_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous <em>there is</em> favour. <a id="c14_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy. <a id="c14_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish. <a id="c14_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof <em>are</em> the ways of death. <a id="c14_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth <em>is</em> heaviness. <a id="c14_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man <em>shall be satisfied</em> from himself. <a id="c14_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The simple believeth every word: but the prudent <em>man</em> looketh well to his going. <a id="c14_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> A wise <em>man</em> feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident. <a id="c14_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> <em>He that is</em> soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated. <a id="c14_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. <a id="c14_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. <a id="c14_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich <em>hath</em> many friends. <a id="c14_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy <em>is</em> he. <a id="c14_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth <em>shall be</em> to them that devise good. <a id="c14_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips <em>tendeth</em> only to penury. <a id="c14_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The crown of the wise <em>is</em> their riches: <em>but</em> the foolishness of fools <em>is</em> folly. <a id="c14_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful <em>witness</em> speaketh lies. <a id="c14_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> In the fear of the LORD <em>is</em> strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge. <a id="c14_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The fear of the LORD <em>is</em> a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. <a id="c14_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> In the multitude of people <em>is</em> the king's honour: but in the want of people <em>is</em> the destruction of the prince. <a id="c14_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> <em>He that is</em> slow to wrath <em>is</em> of great understanding: but <em>he that is</em> hasty of spirit exalteth folly. <a id="c14_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> A sound heart <em>is</em> the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones. <a id="c14_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor. <a id="c14_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death. <a id="c14_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but <em>that which is</em> in the midst of fools is made known. <a id="c14_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin <em>is</em> a reproach to any people. <a id="c14_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> The king's favour <em>is</em> toward a wise servant: but his wrath is <em>against</em> him that causeth shame.
