<h2>Psalms 53</h2>

<a id="c53_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, <em>A Psalm</em> of David.</b> The fool hath said in his heart, <em>There is</em> no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: <em>there is</em> none that doeth good. <a id="c53_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were <em>any</em> that did understand, that did seek God. <a id="c53_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; <em>there is</em> none that doeth good, no, not one. <a id="c53_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people <em>as</em> they eat bread: they have not called upon God. <a id="c53_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> There were they in great fear, <em>where</em> no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth <em>against</em> thee: thou hast put <em>them</em> to shame, because God hath despised them. <a id="c53_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Oh that the salvation of Israel <em>were come</em> out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, <em>and</em> Israel shall be glad.
