<h2>Proverbs 15</h2>

<a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger. <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness. <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The eyes of the LORD <em>are</em> in every place, beholding the evil and the good. <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> A wholesome tongue <em>is</em> a tree of life: but perverseness therein <em>is</em> a breach in the spirit. <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent. <a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> In the house of the righteous <em>is</em> much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. <a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish <em>doeth</em> not so. <a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The sacrifice of the wicked <em>is</em> an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright <em>is</em> his delight. <a id="c15_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The way of the wicked <em>is</em> an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. <a id="c15_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Correction <em>is</em> grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: <em>and</em> he that hateth reproof shall die. <a id="c15_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Hell and destruction <em>are</em> before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men? <a id="c15_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise. <a id="c15_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken. <a id="c15_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness. <a id="c15_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> All the days of the afflicted <em>are</em> evil: but he that is of a merry heart <em>hath</em> a continual feast. <a id="c15_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Better <em>is</em> little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith. <a id="c15_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Better <em>is</em> a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. <a id="c15_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but <em>he that is</em> slow to anger appeaseth strife. <a id="c15_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The way of the slothful <em>man is</em> as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous <em>is</em> made plain. <a id="c15_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother. <a id="c15_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Folly <em>is</em> joy to <em>him that is</em> destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly. <a id="c15_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established. <a id="c15_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word <em>spoken</em> in due season, how good <em>is it</em>! <a id="c15_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The way of life <em>is</em> above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath. <a id="c15_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow. <a id="c15_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> The thoughts of the wicked <em>are</em> an abomination to the LORD: but <em>the words</em> of the pure <em>are</em> pleasant words. <a id="c15_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live. <a id="c15_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things. <a id="c15_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> The LORD <em>is</em> far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous. <a id="c15_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: <em>and</em> a good report maketh the bones fat. <a id="c15_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise. <a id="c15_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding. <a id="c15_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> The fear of the LORD <em>is</em> the instruction of wisdom; and before honour <em>is</em> humility.
