<h2>1 Samuel 13</h2>

<a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel, <a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Saul chose him three thousand <em>men</em> of Israel; <em>whereof</em> two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent. <a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that <em>was</em> in Geba, and the Philistines heard <em>of it</em>. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear. <a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And all Israel heard say <em>that</em> Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and <em>that</em> Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal. <a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which <em>is</em> on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven. <a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits. <a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And <em>some of</em> the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he <em>was</em> yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. <a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel <em>had appointed</em>: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. <a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering. <a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. <a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and <em>that</em> thou camest not within the days appointed, and <em>that</em> the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash; <a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering. <a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. <a id="c13_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him <em>to be</em> captain over his people, because thou hast not kept <em>that</em> which the LORD commanded thee. <a id="c13_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people <em>that were</em> present with him, about six hundred men. <a id="c13_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people <em>that were</em> present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. <a id="c13_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way <em>that leadeth to</em> Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: <a id="c13_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And another company turned the way <em>to</em> Bethhoron: and another company turned <em>to</em> the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. <a id="c13_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make <em>them</em> swords or spears: <a id="c13_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock. <a id="c13_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads. <a id="c13_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that <em>were</em> with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. <a id="c13_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
