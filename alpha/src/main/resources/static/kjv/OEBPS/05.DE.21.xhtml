<h2>Deuteronomy 21</h2>

<a id="c21_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> If <em>one</em> be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, <em>and</em> it be not known who hath slain him: <a id="c21_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which <em>are</em> round about him that is slain: <a id="c21_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And it shall be, <em>that</em> the city <em>which is</em> next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, <em>and</em> which hath not drawn in the yoke; <a id="c21_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley: <a id="c21_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be <em>tried</em>: <a id="c21_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And all the elders of that city, <em>that are</em> next unto the slain <em>man</em>, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley: <a id="c21_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen <em>it</em>. <a id="c21_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them. <a id="c21_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> So shalt thou put away the <em>guilt of</em> innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do <em>that which is</em> right in the sight of the LORD. <a id="c21_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive, <a id="c21_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; <a id="c21_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; <a id="c21_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. <a id="c21_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her. <a id="c21_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, <em>both</em> the beloved and the hated; and <em>if</em> the firstborn son be hers that was hated: <a id="c21_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit <em>that</em> which he hath, <em>that</em> he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, <em>which is indeed</em> the firstborn: <a id="c21_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated <em>for</em> the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he <em>is</em> the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn <em>is</em> his. <a id="c21_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and <em>that</em>, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: <a id="c21_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; <a id="c21_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son <em>is</em> stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; <em>he is</em> a glutton, and a drunkard. <a id="c21_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. <a id="c21_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: <a id="c21_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged <em>is</em> accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee <em>for</em> an inheritance.
