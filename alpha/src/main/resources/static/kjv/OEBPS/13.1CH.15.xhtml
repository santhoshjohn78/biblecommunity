<h2>1 Chronicles 15</h2>

<a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And <em>David</em> made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever. <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it. <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty: <a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: <a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty: <a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: <a id="c15_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: <a id="c15_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve. <a id="c15_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, <a id="c15_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And said unto them, Ye <em>are</em> the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, <em>both</em> ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto <em>the place that</em> I have prepared for it. <a id="c15_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For because ye <em>did it</em> not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. <a id="c15_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel. <a id="c15_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD. <a id="c15_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren <em>to be</em> the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. <a id="c15_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; <a id="c15_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And with them their brethren of the second <em>degree</em>, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters. <a id="c15_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <em>were appointed</em> to sound with cymbals of brass; <a id="c15_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; <a id="c15_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel. <a id="c15_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, <em>was</em> for song: he instructed about the song, because he <em>was</em> skilful. <a id="c15_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Berechiah and Elkanah <em>were</em> doorkeepers for the ark. <a id="c15_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah <em>were</em> doorkeepers for the ark. <a id="c15_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy. <a id="c15_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. <a id="c15_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And David <em>was</em> clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also <em>had</em> upon him an ephod of linen. <a id="c15_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. <a id="c15_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And it came to pass, <em>as</em> the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.
