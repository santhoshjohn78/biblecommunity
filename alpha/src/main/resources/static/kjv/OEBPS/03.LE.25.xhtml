<h2>Leviticus 25</h2>

<a id="c25_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, <a id="c25_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD. <a id="c25_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; <a id="c25_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. <a id="c25_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: <em>for</em> it is a year of rest unto the land. <a id="c25_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee, <a id="c25_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And for thy cattle, and for the beast that <em>are</em> in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat. <a id="c25_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years. <a id="c25_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth <em>day</em> of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. <a id="c25_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout <em>all</em> the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. <a id="c25_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather <em>the grapes</em> in it of thy vine undressed. <a id="c25_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For it <em>is</em> the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field. <a id="c25_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession. <a id="c25_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest <em>ought</em> of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another: <a id="c25_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, <em>and</em> according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee: <a id="c25_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for <em>according</em> to the number <em>of the years</em> of the fruits doth he sell unto thee. <a id="c25_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I <em>am</em> the LORD your God. <a id="c25_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. <a id="c25_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety. <a id="c25_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: <a id="c25_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years. <a id="c25_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat <em>yet</em> of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat <em>of</em> the old <em>store</em>. <a id="c25_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land <em>is</em> mine; for ye <em>are</em> strangers and sojourners with me. <a id="c25_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land. <a id="c25_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away <em>some</em> of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold. <a id="c25_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it; <a id="c25_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession. <a id="c25_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> But if he be not able to restore <em>it</em> to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession. <a id="c25_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; <em>within</em> a full year may he redeem it. <a id="c25_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that <em>is</em> in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile. <a id="c25_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile. <a id="c25_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, <em>and</em> the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time. <a id="c25_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in <em>the year of</em> jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites <em>are</em> their possession among the children of Israel. <a id="c25_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it <em>is</em> their perpetual possession. <a id="c25_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: <em>yea, though he be</em> a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee. <a id="c25_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee. <a id="c25_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase. <a id="c25_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> I <em>am</em> the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, <em>and</em> to be your God. <a id="c25_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And if thy brother <em>that dwelleth</em> by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant: <a id="c25_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> <em>But</em> as an hired servant, <em>and</em> as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, <em>and</em> shall serve thee unto the year of jubile: <a id="c25_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And <em>then</em> shall he depart from thee, <em>both</em> he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return. <a id="c25_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> For they <em>are</em> my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen. <a id="c25_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God. <a id="c25_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, <em>shall be</em> of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. <a id="c25_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that <em>are</em> with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession. <a id="c25_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit <em>them for</em> a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour. <a id="c25_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother <em>that dwelleth</em> by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger <em>or</em> sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family: <a id="c25_v48"></a><span class="vn">48</span> After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him: <a id="c25_v49"></a><span class="vn">49</span> Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or <em>any</em> that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself. <a id="c25_v50"></a><span class="vn">50</span> And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him. <a id="c25_v51"></a><span class="vn">51</span> If <em>there be</em> yet many years <em>behind</em>, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. <a id="c25_v52"></a><span class="vn">52</span> And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, <em>and</em> according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption. <a id="c25_v53"></a><span class="vn">53</span> <em>And</em> as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: <em>and the other</em> shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight. <a id="c25_v54"></a><span class="vn">54</span> And if he be not redeemed in these <em>years</em>, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, <em>both</em> he, and his children with him. <a id="c25_v55"></a><span class="vn">55</span> For unto me the children of Israel <em>are</em> servants; they <em>are</em> my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I <em>am</em> the LORD your God.
