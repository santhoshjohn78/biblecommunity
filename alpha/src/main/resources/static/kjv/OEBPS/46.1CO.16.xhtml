<h2>1 Corinthians 16</h2>

<a id="c16_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. <a id="c16_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Upon the first <em>day</em> of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as <em>God</em> hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. <a id="c16_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by <em>your</em> letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. <a id="c16_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. <a id="c16_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia. <a id="c16_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. <a id="c16_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. <a id="c16_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. <a id="c16_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and <em>there are</em> many adversaries. <a id="c16_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also <em>do</em>. <a id="c16_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren. <a id="c16_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> As touching <em>our</em> brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time. <a id="c16_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. <a id="c16_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Let all your things be done with charity. <a id="c16_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and <em>that</em> they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,) <a id="c16_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with <em>us</em>, and laboureth. <a id="c16_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied. <a id="c16_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such. <a id="c16_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. <a id="c16_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss. <a id="c16_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> The salutation of <em>me</em> Paul with mine own hand. <a id="c16_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha. <a id="c16_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <em>be</em> with you. <a id="c16_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> My love <em>be</em> with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.<blue> The first <em>epistle</em> to the Corinthians was written from Philippi by Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus and Timotheus.</blue>
