<h2>Esther 10</h2>

<a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and <em>upon</em> the isles of the sea. <a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, <em>are</em> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? <a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For Mordecai the Jew <em>was</em> next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.
