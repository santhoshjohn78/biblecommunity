<h2>Psalms 95</h2>

<a id="c95_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. <a id="c95_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. <a id="c95_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For the LORD <em>is</em> a great God, and a great King above all gods. <a id="c95_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> In his hand <em>are</em> the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills <em>is</em> his also. <a id="c95_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The sea <em>is</em> his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry <em>land</em>. <a id="c95_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker. <a id="c95_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For he <em>is</em> our God; and we <em>are</em> the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice, <a id="c95_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, <em>and</em> as <em>in</em> the day of temptation in the wilderness: <a id="c95_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. <a id="c95_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Forty years long was I grieved with <em>this</em> generation, and said, It <em>is</em> a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: <a id="c95_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
