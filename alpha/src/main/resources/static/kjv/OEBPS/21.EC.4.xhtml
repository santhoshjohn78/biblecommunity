<h2>Ecclesiastes 4</h2>

<a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of <em>such as were</em> oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors <em>there was</em> power; but they had no comforter. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Yea, better <em>is he</em> than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This <em>is</em> also vanity and vexation of spirit. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Better <em>is</em> an handful <em>with</em> quietness, than both the hands full <em>with</em> travail and vexation of spirit. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> There is one <em>alone</em>, and <em>there is</em> not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet <em>is there</em> no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither <em>saith he</em>, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This <em>is</em> also vanity, yea, it <em>is</em> a sore travail. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Two <em>are</em> better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him <em>that is</em> alone when he falleth; for <em>he hath</em> not another to help him up. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm <em>alone</em>? <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Better <em>is</em> a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also <em>he that is</em> born in his kingdom becometh poor. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> <em>There is</em> no end of all the people, <em>even</em> of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also <em>is</em> vanity and vexation of spirit.
