<h2>2 Timothy 3</h2>

<a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all <em>men</em>, as theirs also was. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of <em>them</em> all the Lord delivered me. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned <em>them</em>; <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> All scripture <em>is</em> given by inspiration of God, and <em>is</em> profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.
