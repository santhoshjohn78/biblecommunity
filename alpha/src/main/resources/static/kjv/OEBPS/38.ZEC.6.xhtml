<h2>Zechariah 6</h2>

<a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains <em>were</em> mountains of brass. <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> In the first chariot <em>were</em> red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses. <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What <em>are</em> these, my lord? <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the angel answered and said unto me, These <em>are</em> the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The black horses which <em>are</em> therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Take of <em>them of</em> the captivity, <em>even</em> of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set <em>them</em> upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name <em>is</em> The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD: <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. <a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD. <a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And they <em>that are</em> far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And <em>this</em> shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.
