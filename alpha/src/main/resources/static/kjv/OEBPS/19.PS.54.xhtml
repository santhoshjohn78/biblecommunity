<h2>Psalms 54</h2>

<a id="c54_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, <em>A Psalm</em> of David, when the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us?</b> Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength. <a id="c54_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. <a id="c54_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. <a id="c54_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Behold, God <em>is</em> mine helper: the Lord <em>is</em> with them that uphold my soul. <a id="c54_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth. <a id="c54_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for <em>it is</em> good. <a id="c54_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen <em>his desire</em> upon mine enemies.
