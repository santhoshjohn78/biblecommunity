<h2>Psalms 1</h2>

<a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Blessed <em>is</em> the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> But his delight <em>is</em> in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The ungodly <em>are</em> not so: but <em>are</em> like the chaff which the wind driveth away. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
