<h2>Jeremiah 43</h2>

<a id="c43_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass, <em>that</em> when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, <em>even</em> all these words, <a id="c43_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there: <a id="c43_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon. <a id="c43_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah. <a id="c43_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah; <a id="c43_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> <em>Even</em> men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. <a id="c43_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they <em>even</em> to Tahpanhes. <a id="c43_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, <a id="c43_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which <em>is</em> at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; <a id="c43_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them. <a id="c43_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, <em>and deliver</em> such <em>as are</em> for death to death; and such <em>as are</em> for captivity to captivity; and such <em>as are</em> for the sword to the sword. <a id="c43_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace. <a id="c43_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that <em>is</em> in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.
