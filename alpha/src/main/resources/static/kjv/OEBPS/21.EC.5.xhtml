<h2>Ecclesiastes 5</h2>

<a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter <em>any</em> thing before God: for God <em>is</em> in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice <em>is known</em> by multitude of words. <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for <em>he hath</em> no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Better <em>is it</em> that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it <em>was</em> an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For in the multitude of dreams and many words <em>there are</em> also <em>divers</em> vanities: but fear thou God. <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for <em>he that is</em> higher than the highest regardeth; and <em>there be</em> higher than they. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king <em>himself</em> is served by the field. <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this <em>is</em> also vanity. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good <em>is there</em> to the owners thereof, saving the beholding <em>of them</em> with their eyes? <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The sleep of a labouring man <em>is</em> sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> There is a sore evil <em>which</em> I have seen under the sun, <em>namely</em>, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and <em>there is</em> nothing in his hand. <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And this also <em>is</em> a sore evil, <em>that</em> in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind? <a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> All his days also he eateth in darkness, and <em>he hath</em> much sorrow and wrath with his sickness. <a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Behold <em>that</em> which I have seen: <em>it is</em> good and comely <em>for one</em> to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it <em>is</em> his portion. <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this <em>is</em> the gift of God. <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth <em>him</em> in the joy of his heart.
