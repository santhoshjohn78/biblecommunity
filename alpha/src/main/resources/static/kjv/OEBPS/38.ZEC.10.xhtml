<h2>Zechariah 10</h2>

<a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; <em>so</em> the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field. <a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because <em>there was</em> no shepherd. <a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle. <a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together. <a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And they shall be as mighty <em>men</em>, which tread down <em>their enemies</em> in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD <em>is</em> with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded. <a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I <em>am</em> the LORD their God, and will hear them. <a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And <em>they of</em> Ephraim shall be like a mighty <em>man</em>, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see <em>it</em>, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD. <a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased. <a id="c10_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again. <a id="c10_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and <em>place</em> shall not be found for them. <a id="c10_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away. <a id="c10_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.
