<h2>Zephaniah 3</h2>

<a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city! <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God. <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Her princes within her <em>are</em> roaring lions; her judges <em>are</em> evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Her prophets <em>are</em> light <em>and</em> treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The just LORD <em>is</em> in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, <em>and</em> corrupted all their doings. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination <em>is</em> to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, <em>even</em> all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, <em>even</em> the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering. <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make <em>them</em> afraid. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, <em>even</em> the LORD, <em>is</em> in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: <em>and to</em> Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The LORD thy God in the midst of thee <em>is</em> mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> I will gather <em>them that are</em> sorrowful for the solemn assembly, <em>who</em> are of thee, <em>to whom</em> the reproach of it <em>was</em> a burden. <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> At that time will I bring you <em>again</em>, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.
