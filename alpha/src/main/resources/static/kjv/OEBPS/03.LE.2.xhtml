<h2>Leviticus 2</h2>

<a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be <em>of</em> fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon: <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, <em>to be</em> an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the remnant of the meat offering <em>shall be</em> Aaron's and his sons': <em>it is</em> a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, <em>it shall be</em> unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And if thy oblation <em>be</em> a meat offering <em>baken</em> in a pan, it shall be <em>of</em> fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it <em>is</em> a meat offering. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And if thy oblation <em>be</em> a meat offering <em>baken</em> in the fryingpan, it shall be made <em>of</em> fine flour with oil. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn <em>it</em> upon the altar: <em>it is</em> an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And that which is left of the meat offering <em>shall be</em> Aaron's and his sons': <em>it is</em> a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour. <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, <em>even</em> corn beaten out of full ears. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it <em>is</em> a meat offering. <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, <em>part</em> of the beaten corn thereof, and <em>part</em> of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: <em>it is</em> an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
