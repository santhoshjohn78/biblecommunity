<h2>Proverbs 24</h2>

<a id="c24_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them. <a id="c24_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief. <a id="c24_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established: <a id="c24_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. <a id="c24_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> A wise man<em> is</em> strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength. <a id="c24_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors<em> there is</em> safety. <a id="c24_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Wisdom<em> is</em> too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate. <a id="c24_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person. <a id="c24_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The thought of foolishness<em> is</em> sin: and the scorner<em> is</em> an abomination to men. <a id="c24_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> <em>If</em> thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength<em> is</em> small. <a id="c24_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> If thou forbear to deliver<em> them that are</em> drawn unto death, and<em> those that are</em> ready to be slain; <a id="c24_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider<em> it</em>? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth<em> not</em> he know<em> it</em>? and shall<em> not</em> he render to<em> every</em> man according to his works? <a id="c24_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> My son, eat thou honey, because<em> it is</em> good; and the honeycomb,<em> which is</em> sweet to thy taste: <a id="c24_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> So<em> shall</em> the knowledge of wisdom<em> be</em> unto thy soul: when thou hast found<em> it</em>, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off. <a id="c24_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Lay not wait, O wicked<em> man</em>, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place: <a id="c24_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> For a just<em> man</em> falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief. <a id="c24_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: <a id="c24_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Lest the LORD see<em> it</em>, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him. <a id="c24_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Fret not thyself because of evil<em> men</em>, neither be thou envious at the wicked; <a id="c24_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For there shall be no reward to the evil<em> man</em>; the candle of the wicked shall be put out. <a id="c24_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> My son, fear thou the LORD and the king:<em> and</em> meddle not with them that are given to change: <a id="c24_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both? <a id="c24_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> These<em> things</em> also<em> belong</em> to the wise.<em> It is</em> not good to have respect of persons in judgment. <a id="c24_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> He that saith unto the wicked, Thou<em> art</em> righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him: <a id="c24_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> But to them that rebuke<em> him</em> shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them. <a id="c24_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> <em>Every man</em> shall kiss<em> his</em> lips that giveth a right answer. <a id="c24_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house. <a id="c24_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive<em> not</em> with thy lips. <a id="c24_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work. <a id="c24_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; <a id="c24_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns,<em> and</em> nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down. <a id="c24_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> Then I saw,<em> and</em> considered<em> it</em> well: I looked upon<em> it, and</em> received instruction. <a id="c24_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> <em>Yet</em> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: <a id="c24_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> So shall thy poverty come<em> as</em> one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.
