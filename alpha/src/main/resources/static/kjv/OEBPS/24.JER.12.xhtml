<h2>Jeremiah 12</h2>

<a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Righteous <em>art</em> thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of <em>thy</em> judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? <em>wherefore</em> are all they happy that deal very treacherously? <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou <em>art</em> near in their mouth, and far from their reins. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter. <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and <em>if</em> in the land of peace, <em>wherein</em> thou trustedst, <em>they wearied thee</em>, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan? <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it. <a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Mine heritage <em>is</em> unto me <em>as</em> a speckled bird, the birds round about <em>are</em> against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour. <a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. <a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> They have made it desolate, <em>and being</em> desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth <em>it</em> to heart. <a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the <em>one</em> end of the land even to the <em>other</em> end of the land: no flesh shall have peace. <a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, <em>but</em> shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD. <a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them. <a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. <a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people. <a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD.
