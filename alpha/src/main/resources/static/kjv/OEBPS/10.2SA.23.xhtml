<h2>2 Samuel 23</h2>

<a id="c23_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now these <em>be</em> the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man <em>who was</em> raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said, <a id="c23_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word <em>was</em> in my tongue. <a id="c23_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men <em>must be</em> just, ruling in the fear of God. <a id="c23_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And <em>he shall be</em> as the light of the morning, <em>when</em> the sun riseth, <em>even</em> a morning without clouds; <em>as</em> the tender grass <em>springing</em> out of the earth by clear shining after rain. <a id="c23_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Although my house <em>be</em> not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all <em>things</em>, and sure: for <em>this is</em> all my salvation, and all <em>my</em> desire, although he make <em>it</em> not to grow. <a id="c23_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> But <em>the sons</em> of Belial <em>shall be</em> all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands: <a id="c23_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But the man <em>that</em> shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the <em>same</em> place. <a id="c23_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> These <em>be</em> the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same <em>was</em> Adino the Eznite: <em>he lift up his spear</em> against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time. <a id="c23_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And after him <em>was</em> Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, <em>one</em> of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines <em>that</em> were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away: <a id="c23_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil. <a id="c23_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And after him <em>was</em> Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines. <a id="c23_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory. <a id="c23_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim. <a id="c23_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And David <em>was</em> then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines <em>was</em> then <em>in</em> Bethlehem. <a id="c23_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which <em>is</em> by the gate! <a id="c23_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that <em>was</em> by the gate, and took <em>it</em>, and brought <em>it</em> to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD. <a id="c23_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: <em>is not this</em> the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men. <a id="c23_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, <em>and</em> slew <em>them</em>, and had the name among three. <a id="c23_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the <em>first</em> three. <a id="c23_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow: <a id="c23_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. <a id="c23_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> These <em>things</em> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men. <a id="c23_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the <em>first</em> three. And David set him over his guard. <a id="c23_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Asahel the brother of Joab <em>was</em> one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, <a id="c23_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, <a id="c23_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, <a id="c23_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, <a id="c23_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, <a id="c23_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, <a id="c23_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash, <a id="c23_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, <a id="c23_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, <a id="c23_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite, <a id="c23_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, <a id="c23_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, <a id="c23_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, <a id="c23_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah, <a id="c23_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite, <a id="c23_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.
