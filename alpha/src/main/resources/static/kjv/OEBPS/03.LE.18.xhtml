<h2>Leviticus 18</h2>

<a id="c18_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <a id="c18_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God. <a id="c18_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances. <a id="c18_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I <em>am</em> the LORD your God. <a id="c18_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I <em>am</em> the LORD. <a id="c18_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover <em>their</em> nakedness: I <em>am</em> the LORD. <a id="c18_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she <em>is</em> thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. <a id="c18_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it <em>is</em> thy father's nakedness. <a id="c18_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, <em>whether she be</em> born at home, or born abroad, <em>even</em> their nakedness thou shalt not uncover. <a id="c18_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, <em>even</em> their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs <em>is</em> thine own nakedness. <a id="c18_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she <em>is</em> thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. <a id="c18_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she <em>is</em> thy father's near kinswoman. <a id="c18_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she <em>is</em> thy mother's near kinswoman. <a id="c18_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she <em>is</em> thine aunt. <a id="c18_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she <em>is</em> thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. <a id="c18_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it <em>is</em> thy brother's nakedness. <a id="c18_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; <em>for</em> they <em>are</em> her near kinswomen: it <em>is</em> wickedness. <a id="c18_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex <em>her</em>, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life <em>time</em>. <a id="c18_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness. <a id="c18_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her. <a id="c18_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through <em>the fire</em> to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I <em>am</em> the LORD. <a id="c18_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it <em>is</em> abomination. <a id="c18_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it <em>is</em> confusion. <a id="c18_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you: <a id="c18_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants. <a id="c18_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit <em>any</em> of these abominations; <em>neither</em> any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you: <a id="c18_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which <em>were</em> before you, and the land is defiled;) <a id="c18_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that <em>were</em> before you. <a id="c18_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit <em>them</em> shall be cut off from among their people. <a id="c18_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that <em>ye</em> commit not <em>any one</em> of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I <em>am</em> the LORD your God.
