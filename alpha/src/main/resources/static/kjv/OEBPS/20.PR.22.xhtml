<h2>Proverbs 22</h2>

<a id="c22_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A <em>good</em> name <em>is</em> rather to be chosen than great riches, <em>and</em> loving favour rather than silver and gold. <a id="c22_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The rich and poor meet together: the LORD <em>is</em> the maker of them all. <a id="c22_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> A prudent <em>man</em> foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished. <a id="c22_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> By humility <em>and</em> the fear of the LORD <em>are</em> riches, and honour, and life. <a id="c22_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thorns <em>and</em> snares <em>are</em> in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them. <a id="c22_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. <a id="c22_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower<em> is</em> servant to the lender. <a id="c22_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail. <a id="c22_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor. <a id="c22_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease. <a id="c22_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> He that loveth pureness of heart,<em> for</em> the grace of his lips the king<em> shall be</em> his friend. <a id="c22_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor. <a id="c22_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The slothful<em> man</em> saith,<em> There is</em> a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets. <a id="c22_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The mouth of strange women<em> is</em> a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein. <a id="c22_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Foolishness<em> is</em> bound in the heart of a child;<em> but</em> the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. <a id="c22_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> He that oppresseth the poor to increase his<em> riches, and</em> he that giveth to the rich,<em> shall</em> surely<em> come</em> to want. <a id="c22_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. <a id="c22_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For<em> it is</em> a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips. <a id="c22_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee. <a id="c22_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge, <a id="c22_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee? <a id="c22_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Rob not the poor, because he<em> is</em> poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate: <a id="c22_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them. <a id="c22_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go: <a id="c22_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul. <a id="c22_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Be not thou<em> one</em> of them that strike hands,<em> or</em> of them that are sureties for debts. <a id="c22_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee? <a id="c22_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set. <a id="c22_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean<em> men</em>.
