<h2>Zephaniah 2</h2>

<a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired; <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Before the decree bring forth, <em>before</em> the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the LORD'S anger come upon you. <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD'S anger. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD <em>is</em> against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the sea coast shall be dwellings <em>and</em> cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified <em>themselves</em> against their border. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Therefore <em>as</em> I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, <em>even</em> the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified <em>themselves</em> against the people of the LORD of hosts. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The LORD <em>will be</em> terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and <em>men</em> shall worship him, every one from his place, <em>even</em> all the isles of the heathen. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Ye Ethiopians also, ye <em>shall be</em> slain by my sword. <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, <em>and</em> dry like a wilderness. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; <em>their</em> voice shall sing in the windows; desolation <em>shall be</em> in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> This <em>is</em> the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I <em>am</em>, and <em>there is</em> none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, <em>and</em> wag his hand.
