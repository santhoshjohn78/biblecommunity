<h2>Psalms 3</h2>

<a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> <b>A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.</b> LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many <em>are</em> they that rise up against me. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Many <em>there be</em> which say of my soul, <em>There is</em> no help for him in God. Selah. <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But thou, O LORD, <em>art</em> a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set <em>themselves</em> against me round about. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies <em>upon</em> the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Salvation <em>belongeth</em> unto the LORD: thy blessing <em>is</em> upon thy people. Selah.
