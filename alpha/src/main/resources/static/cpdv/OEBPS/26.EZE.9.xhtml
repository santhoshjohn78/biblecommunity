<h2>Ezekiel 9</h2>

<p><a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And he cried out in my ears with a loud voice, saying: "The visitations of the city have drawn near, and each one has equipment for killing in his hand."</p>

<p><a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And behold, six men were approaching from the way of the upper gate, which looks to the north. And each one had equipment for killing in his hand. Also, one man in their midst was clothed with linen, and an instrument for writing was at his waist. And they entered and stood beside the bronze altar.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the glory of the Lord of Israel was taken up, from the cherub upon which he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called out to the man who was clothed with linen and had an instrument for writing at his waist.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the Lord said to him: "Cross through the middle of the city, in the center of Jerusalem, and seal a Tau upon the foreheads of the grieving men, who are mourning over all the abominations which are being committed in its midst."</p>

<p><a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And he said to the others, in my hearing: "Cross through the city after him, and strike! Your eye shall not be lenient, and you shall not take pity.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Kill, even to utter destruction, old men, young men, and virgins, little ones, and women. But all upon whom see the Tau, you shall not kill. And begin from my sanctuary." Therefore, they began with the men among the elders, who were before the face of the house.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And he said to them: "Defile the house, and fill its courts with the slain! Go forth!" And they went forth and struck down those who were in the city.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And when the slaughter was completed, I remained. And I fell upon my face, and crying out, I said: "Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God! Will you now destroy the entire remnant of Israel, by pouring out your fury upon Jerusalem?"</p>

<p><a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he said to me: "The iniquity of the house of Israel, and of Judah, is vast and exceedingly great, and the land has been filled with blood, and the city has been filled with what is abhorrent. For they have said: 'The Lord has forsaken the earth,' and, 'The Lord does not see.'</p>

<p><a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Therefore, my eye will not be lenient, and I will not take pity. I will repay their own way upon their head."</p>

<p><a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And behold, the man who was clothed with linen, who had a writing instrument at his back, responded a word, saying: "I have done just as you instructed me."</p>
