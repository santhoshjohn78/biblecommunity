<h2>Jeremiah 46</h2>

<p><a id="c46_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles,</p>

<p><a id="c46_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> about Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh Neco, the king of Egypt, which was beside the river Euphrates at Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, struck down, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah:</p>

<p><a id="c46_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> " 'Prepare the heavy and the light shield, and advance to war!</p>

<p><a id="c46_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Harness the horses, and let the horsemen climb upon them! Stand forth with helmets! Sharpen the lances! Clothe yourselves in armor!'</p>

<p><a id="c46_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And what is next? I have seen them terrified, and turning their backs, their strong ones cut down. They have fled in disorder and have not looked back. Terror on every side, says the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let not the swift take flight; let not the strong ones think to save themselves. They have been conquered and ruined, toward the north, near the river Euphrates.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Who is this, who ascends like a flood, and whose streams swell up, like those of the rivers?</p>

<p><a id="c46_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Egypt ascends in the form of a river, and its waves will be moved like those of a river. And he will say: 'I will ascend and cover the earth! I will perish the city and its inhabitants!'</p>

<p><a id="c46_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Mount the horses, and exult upon chariots, and let the strong ones advance: the Ethiopians, and the Libyans, who hold the heavy shield, and the Lydians, who grasp and shoot arrows.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For this is the day of the Lord, the God of hosts, a day of vengeance, so that he may vindicate himself of his enemies. The sword will devour, and be satiated, and be inebriated with their blood. For there is a victim of the Lord, the God of hosts, in the land of the north, beside the river Euphrates.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Ascend to Gilead, and take its balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! It is in vain that you multiply medicines; there will be no health for you!</p>

<p><a id="c46_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The nations have heard of your disgrace, and your wailing has filled the earth. For the strong have stumbled against the strong, and both have fallen together."</p>

<p><a id="c46_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The word that the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, concerning how Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, would arrive and strike the land of Egypt:</p>

<p><a id="c46_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> "Announce it to Egypt, and make it heard in Migdol, and let it resonate in Memphis and in Tahpanhes. Say this: Stand and prepare yourself! For the sword will devour everything around you.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Why have your strong ones decayed? They have not stood firm, because the Lord has overthrown them.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> He has multiplied those in ruin, and each man has fallen beside his neighbor. And they will say: 'Rise up, and let us return to our own people and to the land of our nativity, away from the face of the sword of the dove.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Call the name of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt: 'Time has brought tumult.'</p>

<p><a id="c46_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> As I live, says the King, whose name is the Lord of hosts, just as Tabor is among the mountains, and just as Carmel is beside the sea, so will he come.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Equip yourself for the transmigration, O daughter who inhabitants Egypt. For Memphis will be in desolation, and it will be deserted and uninhabited.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Egypt is like a stately and finely-formed calf. The one who will goad her will come from the north.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Her hired hands also, who move within her midst, like fatted calves have been turned back, and they have fled at the same time, and they are not able to stand firm. For the day of their passing away has overwhelmed them; it is the time of their visitation.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Her voice will sound out like brass. For they will rush forward with an army, and with axes they will come against her, like those who chop wood.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> They have cut down her forest, says the Lord, which was not able to be counted. They have been multiplied more than locusts, and they are without number.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> The daughter of Egypt has been confounded, and she has been delivered into the hand of the people of the north.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, said: Behold, I will visit against the tumult of Alexandria, and against Pharaoh, and against Egypt, and against her gods, and against her kings, and against Pharaoh, and against those who trust in him.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And I will give them over to the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants. And after this, it shall be inhabited, just as in the former days, says the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And as for you, my servant Jacob, you should not be afraid, and you should not dread, O Israel. For behold, I will bring your salvation from afar, and your offspring from the land of your captivity. And Jacob will return and have rest, and he will prosper. And there will be no one who may terrify him.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And as for you, my servant Jacob, do not be afraid, says the Lord. For I am with you. For I will consume all the nations to which I have cast you out. Yet truly, I will not consume you. Instead, I will chastise you in judgment, but neither will I spare you, as if you were innocent."</p>
