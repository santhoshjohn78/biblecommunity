<h2>Psalms 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In parts according to verses. A Psalm of David. For the octave.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> O Lord, do not rebuke me in your fury, nor chastise me in your anger.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am weak. Heal me, Lord, for my bones have become disturbed,</p>

<p><a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and my soul has been very troubled. But as for you, Lord, when?</p>

<p><a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Turn to me, Lord, and rescue my soul. Save me because of your mercy.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For there is no one in death who would be mindful of you. And who will confess to you in Hell?</p>

<p><a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I have labored in my groaning. Every night, with my tears, I will wash my bed and drench my blanket.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> My eye has been troubled by rage. I have grown old among all my enemies.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Scatter before me, all you who work iniquity, for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The Lord has heard my supplication. The Lord has accepted my prayer.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Let all my enemies be ashamed and together be greatly troubled. May they be converted and become ashamed very quickly.</p>
