<h2>Ezekiel 45</h2>

<p><a id="c45_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> "And when you will begin to divide the land by lot, separate as first-fruits for the Lord a sanctified portion of the land, in length twenty-five thousand and in width ten thousand. It will be holy within all its borders all around.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And there shall be, out of the entire region, a sanctified portion of five hundred by five hundred, foursquare all around, with fifty cubits for its suburbs on all sides.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And with this measure, you shall measure a length of twenty-five thousand, and a width of ten thousand, and within it shall be the temple and the Holy of Holies.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The sanctified portion of the land shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who approach for the ministry of the Lord. And it shall be a place for their houses, and for the holy place of the sanctuary.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Now twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in width shall be for the Levites, who minister in the house. They shall possess twenty storerooms.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And you shall appoint a possession in the city of five thousand in width, and twenty-five thousand in length, in accord with the separation of the sanctuary, for the entire house of Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Appoint the same for the prince, on one side and on the other, in the separation of the sanctuary, and in the possession of the city, opposite the face of the separation of the sanctuary, and opposite the face of the possession of the city, from the side of the sea even to the sea, and from the side of the east even to the east. And the length shall be just as in each part, from the western border even to the eastern border.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> A portion of the land in Israel shall be for him. And the princes shall no longer plunder my people. Instead, they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Thus says the Lord God: Let this be sufficient for you, O princes of Israel! Cease from iniquity and robberies, and execute judgment and justice. Separate your confines from my people, says the Lord God.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> You shall have just scales, and a just unit of dry measure, and a just unit of liquid measure.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The units of dry and liquid measure shall be one uniform measure, so that a bath contains one tenth part of a cor, and an ephah contains one tenth part of a cor; each shall be of equal volume in accord with the measure of a cor.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Now the shekel consists of twenty obols. Furthermore, twenty shekels, and twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels makes one mina.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And these are the first-fruits that you shall take: a sixth part of an ephah from each cor of wheat, and a sixth part of an ephah from each cor of barley.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Likewise, a measure of oil, a bath of oil, is one tenth part of a cor. And ten baths make one cor. For ten baths complete one cor.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And take one ram from each flock of two hundred, out of those that Israel tends for sacrifice and holocausts and peace offerings, in order to make an expiation for them, says the Lord God.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> All the people of the land will take hold of these first-fruits for the prince in Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And concerning the prince, there shall be holocausts and sacrifice and libations, on solemnities and new moons and Sabbaths, and on all the solemnities of the house of Israel. He himself shall offer the sacrifice for sin, and the holocaust, and the peace offerings, in order to make expiation for the house of Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Thus says the Lord God: In the first month, on the first of the month, you shall take an immaculate calf from the herd, and you shall expiate the sanctuary.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And the priest shall take from the blood that will be for the sin offering. And he shall place it on the doorposts of the house, and on the four corners of the rim of the altar, and on the posts of the gate of the inner court.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And so shall you do on the seventh day of the month, on behalf of each one who was ignorant or who was deceived by error. And you shall make expiation for the house.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> In the first month, the fourteenth day of the month shall be for you the solemnity of the Passover. For seven days, unleavened bread shall be eaten.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And on that day, the prince shall offer, on behalf of himself and on behalf of all the people of the land, a calf for sin.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And during the solemnity of the seven days, he shall offer a holocaust to the Lord of seven immaculate calves and seven immaculate rams, daily for seven days, and a he-goat from among the she-goats, daily for sin.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And he shall offer the sacrifice of an ephah for each calf, and an ephah for each ram, and a hin of oil for every ephah.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, during the solemnities, he shall do just as was said above for the seven days, as much for the sin offering, as for the holocaust and sacrifice and oil."</p>
