<h2>Psalms 130</h2>

<p><a id="c130_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Canticle in steps: of David. O Lord, my heart has not been exalted, and my eyes have not been raised up. Neither have I walked in greatness, nor in wonders beyond me.</p>

<p><a id="c130_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> When I was not humble in thought, then I lifted up my soul. Like one who has been weaned from his mother, so was I recompensed in my soul.</p>

<p><a id="c130_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Let Israel hope in the Lord, from this time forward and even forever.</p>
