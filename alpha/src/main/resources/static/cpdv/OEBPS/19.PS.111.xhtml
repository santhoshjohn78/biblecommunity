<h2>Psalms 111</h2>

<p><a id="c111_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Alleluia. Of the return of Haggai and Zachariah. Blessed is the man who fears the Lord. He will prefer his commandments exceedingly.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> His offspring will be powerful on the earth. The generation of the upright will be blessed.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Glory and wealth will be in his house, and his justice shall remain from age to age.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For the upright, a light has risen up in the darkness. He is merciful and compassionate and just.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Pleasing is the man who shows mercy and lends. He will order his words with judgment.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For he will not be disturbed in eternity.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The just one will be an everlasting memorial. He will not fear a report of disasters. His heart is prepared to hope in the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> His heart has been confirmed. He will not be disturbed, until he looks down upon his enemies.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He has distributed, he has given to the poor. His justice shall remain from age to age. His horn shall be exalted in glory.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The sinner will see and become angry. He will gnash his teeth and waste away. The desire of sinners will perish.</p>
