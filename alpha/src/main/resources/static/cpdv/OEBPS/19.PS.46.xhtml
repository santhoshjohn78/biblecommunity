<h2>Psalms 46</h2>

<p><a id="c46_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unto the end. A Psalm for the sons of Korah.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> All nations, clap your hands. Shout joyfully to God with a voice of exultation.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For the Lord is exalted and terrible: a great King over all the earth.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He has subjected the peoples to us and subdued the nations under our feet.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He has chosen us for his inheritance: the splendor of Jacob, whom he has loved.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> God ascends with jubilation, and the Lord with the voice of the trumpet.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Sing psalms to our God, sing psalms. Sing psalms to our King, sing psalms.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For God is the King of all the earth. Sing psalms wisely.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> God will reign over the peoples. God sits upon his holy throne.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The leaders of the peoples have been gathered together by the God of Abraham. For the strong gods of the earth have been exceedingly exalted.</p>
