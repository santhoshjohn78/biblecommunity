<h2>Ezekiel 14</h2>

<p><a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And men among the elders of Israel came to me, and they sat down before me.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> "Son of man, these men have placed their uncleanness in their hearts, and they have stationed the scandal of their iniquities before their face. So why should I respond when they inquire of me?</p>

<p><a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Because of this, speak to them, and you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: The man, the man of the house of Israel, who places his uncleanness in his heart, and who stations the scandal of his iniquities before his face, and who approaches a prophet, so as to inquire of me through him: I, the Lord, will respond to him in accord with the multitude of his uncleannesses,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> so that the house of Israel may be seized within their own heart, by which they have withdrawn from me to all their idols.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Because of this, say to the house of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: Be converted, and withdraw from your idols, and turn your faces away from all your abominations.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For the man, the man of the house of Israel, and the new arrival among the converts who may be in Israel, if he is alienated from me, and he sets his idols in his heart, and he stations the scandal of his iniquity before his face, and he approaches the prophet, so that he may inquire of me through him: I, the Lord, will respond to him through myself.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I will set my face against that man, and I will make him an example and a proverb. And I will perish him from the midst of my people. And you shall know that I am the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And when a prophet has gone astray and has spoken a word: I, the Lord, have deceived that prophet. And I will extend my hand over him, and I will wipe him away from the midst of my people, Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And they shall bear their iniquity. In accord with the iniquity of the one who inquires, so shall the iniquity of the prophet be.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> So may the house of Israel no longer go astray from me, nor be polluted by all their transgressions. Instead, may they be my people, and may I be their God, says the Lord of hosts."</p>

<p><a id="c14_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c14_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> "Son of man, when a land will have sinned against me, so that it transgresses grievously, I will extend my hand over it, and I will crush the staff of its bread. And I will send a famine upon it, and I will destroy from it both man and beast.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver their own souls by their justice, says the Lord of hosts.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And if I also lead in very harmful beasts upon the land, so that I devastate it, and it becomes impassable, so that no one may cross through it because of the beasts,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> if these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord God, they will deliver neither sons, nor daughters. But only they themselves will be delivered, for the land shall be desolated.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Or if I lead in the sword upon that land, and if I say to the sword, 'Pass through the land,' and so I destroy from it both man and beast,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and if these three men were in its midst, as I live, says the Lord God, they will deliver neither sons, nor daughters, but only they themselves will be delivered.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Then, if I also send the pestilence upon that land, and I pour out my indignation upon it with blood, so that I take away from it both man and beast,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and if Noah, and Daniel, and Job were in its midst, as I live, says the Lord God, they will deliver neither son, nor daughter, but they will deliver only their own souls by their justice.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For thus says the Lord God: Even though I will send upon Jerusalem my four most grievous judgments, sword and famine and harmful beasts and pestilence, so that I destroy from it both man and beast,</p>

<p><a id="c14_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> yet still there shall be left within it some who will be saved, who shall lead away their own sons and daughters. Behold, they will enter to you, and you will see their way and their accomplishments. And you shall be consoled concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, concerning all the things that I have brought to bear upon it.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And they shall console you, when you see their ways and their accomplishments. And you shall know that I have not acted to no purpose in all that I have done within it, says the Lord God."</p>
