<h2>Job 25</h2>

<p><a id="c25_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then Baldad the Suhite answered by saying:</p>

<p><a id="c25_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Power and terror are with him that makes a pact with those in high places.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Is there any limit to the number of his soldiers or to the number of those over whom his light rises?</p>

<p><a id="c25_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Is it right for man to compare himself to God, or to appear pure though he is born of woman?</p>

<p><a id="c25_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Behold, even the moon is not radiant, and the stars are not pure, in his sight.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Is man much more than rottenness and the son of man much more than worms?</p>
