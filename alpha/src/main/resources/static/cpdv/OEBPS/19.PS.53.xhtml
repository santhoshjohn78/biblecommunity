<h2>Psalms 53</h2>

<p><a id="c53_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unto the end. In verses, the understanding of David,</p>

<p><a id="c53_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> when the Ziphites had arrived and they said to Saul, "Has not David been hidden with us?"</p>

<p><a id="c53_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Save me, O God, by your name, and judge me in your virtue.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> O God, listen to my prayer. Pay attention to the words of my mouth.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For strangers have risen up against me, and the strong have sought my soul. And they have not set God before their eyes.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For behold, God is my helper, and the Lord is the protector of my soul.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Turn back the evils upon my adversaries, and ruin them by your truth.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I will freely sacrifice to you, and I will confess your name, O God, because it is good.</p>

<p><a id="c53_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For you have quickly rescued me from all tribulation, and my eye has looked down upon my enemies.</p>
