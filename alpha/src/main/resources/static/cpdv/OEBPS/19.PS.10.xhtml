<h2>Psalms 10</h2>

<p><a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unto the end. A Psalm of David.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I trust in the Lord. How can you say to my soul, "Sojourn to the mountain, like a sparrow."</p>

<p><a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For behold, the sinners have bent their bow. They have prepared their arrows in the quiver, so as to shoot arrows in the dark at the upright of heart.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For they have destroyed the things that you have completed. But what has the just one done?</p>

<p><a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The Lord is in his holy temple. The Lord's throne is in heaven. His eyes look upon the poor. His eyelids question the sons of men.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The Lord questions the just and the impious. Yet he who loves iniquity, hates his own soul.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He will rain down snares upon sinners. Fire and brimstone and windstorms will be the portion of their cup.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For the Lord is just, and he has chosen justice. His countenance has beheld equity.</p>
