<h2>2 Kings 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then, after the death of Ahab, Moab transgressed against Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Ahaziah fell down through the lattices of his upper room, which he had in Samaria, and he was injured. And he sent messengers, saying to them, "Go, consult Beelzebub, the god of Ekron, as to whether I may be able to survive this infirmity of mine."</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And an Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah, the Tishbite, saying: "Rise up, and ascend to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria. And you shall say to them: 'Is there not a God in Israel, so that you would go to consult Beelzebub, the god of Ekron?</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For this reason, thus says the Lord: From the bed to which you have ascended, you shall not descend. Instead, dying you shall die.' " And Elijah went away.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the messengers returned to Ahaziah. And he said to them, "Why have you returned?"</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> But they responded to him: "A man met us, and he said to us: 'Go, and return to the king who sent you. And you shall say to him: Thus says the Lord: Is it because there was no God in Israel that you are sending to consult Beelzebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore, from the bed to which you have ascended, you shall not descend. Instead, dying you shall die.' "</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And he said to them: "What was the appearance and dress of that man, who met you and who spoke these words?"</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> So they said, "A hairy man, with a belt of leather wrapping his waist." And he said, "It is Elijah, the Tishbite."</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he sent to him a leader of fifty, with the fifty who were under him. And he ascended to him, sitting at the top of a hill, and he said, "Man of God, the king commanded that you should descend."</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And responding, Elijah said to the leader of fifty, "If I am a man of God, let fire from heaven descend and devour you and your fifty." And then fire from heaven descended and devoured him and the fifty who were with him.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And again, he sent to him another leader of fifty, and the fifty with him. And he said to him, "Man of God, thus says the king: Hurry, descend."</p>

<p><a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Responding, Elijah said, "If I am a man of God, let fire from heaven descend and devour you and your fifty." And fire from heaven descended and devoured him and his fifty.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Again, he sent a third leader of fifty men and the fifty who were with him. And when he had arrived, he bent his knees before Elijah, and he pleaded with him, and said: "Man of God, do not choose to despise my life and the lives of your servants who are with me.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Behold, fire from heaven descended and devoured the two previous leaders of fifty and the fifties who were with them. But now I beg you to take pity on my life."</p>

<p><a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Then the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah, saying, "Descend with him; fear not." And so, he arose and descended with him to the king.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he said to him: "Thus says the Lord: Because you sent messengers to consult Beelzebub, the god of Ekron, as if there were no God in Israel, from whom you would be able to seek a word, therefore, from the bed to which you have ascended, you shall not descend. Instead, dying you shall die."</p>

<p><a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And so he died, in accord with the word of the Lord, which Elijah spoke. And Jehoram, his brother, reigned in his place, in the second year of Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah. For he had no son.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> But the rest of the words of Ahaziah that he worked, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</p>
