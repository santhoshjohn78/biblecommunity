<h2>Psalms 23</h2>

<p><a id="c23_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For the First Sabbath. A Psalm of David. The earth and all its fullness belong to the Lord: the whole world and all that dwells in it.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For he has founded it upon the seas, and he has prepared it upon the rivers.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Who will ascend to the mountain of the Lord? And who will stand in his holy place?</p>

<p><a id="c23_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The innocent of hands and the clean of heart, who has not received his soul in vain, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbor.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He will receive a blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God, his Saviour.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> This is the generation that seeks him, that seeks the face of the God of Jacob.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Lift up your gates, you princes, and be lifted up, eternal gates. And the King of Glory shall enter.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Who is this King of Glory? The Lord who is strong and powerful; the Lord powerful in battle.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Lift up your gates, you princes, and be lifted up, eternal gates. And the King of Glory shall enter.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Who is this King of Glory? The Lord of virtue. He himself is the King of Glory.</p>
