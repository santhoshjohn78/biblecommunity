<h2>Isaiah 20</h2>

<p><a id="c20_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In the year in which Tharthan entered into Ashdod, when Sargon, the king of the Assyrians, had sent him, and when he had fought against Ashdod and had captured it,</p>

<p><a id="c20_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> in that same time, the Lord spoke by the hand of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saying: "Go forth, and remove the sackcloth from your waist, and take your shoes from your feet." And he did so, going out naked and barefoot.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the Lord said: Just as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot, as a sign and as a portent of three years over Egypt and over Ethiopia,</p>

<p><a id="c20_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> so also will the king of the Assyrians force the captivity of Egypt, and the transmigration of Ethiopia: young and old, naked and barefoot, with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And they will be afraid and confounded over Ethiopia, their hope, and Egypt, their glory.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And in that day, the inhabitants of a certain island will say: "Behold, this was our hope, we fled to them for help, to free us from the face of the king of the Assyrians. And now, how will we be able to escape?"</p>
