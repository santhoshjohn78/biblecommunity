<h2>Psalms 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In parts according to verses. A Psalm of David.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> When I called upon him, the God of my justice heeded me. In tribulation, you have enlarged me. Have mercy on me, and heed my prayer.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Sons of men, how long will you be dull in heart, so that whatever you love is in vain, and whatever you seek is false?</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And know this: the Lord has made wondrous his holy one. The Lord will heed me when I cry out to him.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Be angry, and do not be willing to sin. The things that you say in your hearts: be sorry for them on your beds.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Offer the sacrifice of justice, and hope in the Lord. Many say, "Who reveals to us what is good?"</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The light of your countenance, Lord, has been sealed upon us. You have given joy to my heart.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> By the fruit of their grain, wine, and oil, they have been multiplied.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> In peace itself, I will sleep and I will rest.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For you, O Lord, have established me singularly in hope.</p>
