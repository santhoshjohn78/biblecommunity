<h2>Psalms 69</h2>

<p><a id="c69_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unto the end. A Psalm of David, in remembrance that the Lord had saved him.</p>

<p><a id="c69_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> O God, reach out to help me. O Lord, hasten to assist me.</p>

<p><a id="c69_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> May those who seek my soul be confounded and awed.</p>

<p><a id="c69_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> May those who wish evils upon me be turned back and blush with shame. May they be turned away immediately, blushing with shame, who say to me: "Well, well."</p>

<p><a id="c69_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Let all who seek you exult and rejoice in you, and let those who love your salvation forever say: "The Lord be magnified."</p>

<p><a id="c69_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I am truly destitute and poor. O God, assist me. You are my helper and my deliverer. O Lord, do not delay.</p>
