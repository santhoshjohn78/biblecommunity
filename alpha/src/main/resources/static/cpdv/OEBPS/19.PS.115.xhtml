<h2>Psalms 115</h2>

<p><a id="c115_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Alleluia. I had confidence, because of what I was saying, but then I was greatly humbled.</p>

<p><a id="c115_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I said in my excess, "Every man is a liar."</p>

<p><a id="c115_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> What shall I repay to the Lord, for all the things that he has repaid to me?</p>

<p><a id="c115_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I will take up the cup of salvation, and I will call upon the name of the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c115_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I will repay my vows to the Lord, in the sight of all his people.</p>

<p><a id="c115_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his holy ones.</p>

<p><a id="c115_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> O Lord, because I am your servant, your servant and the son of your handmaid, you have broken my bonds.</p>

<p><a id="c115_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I will sacrifice to you the sacrifice of praise, and I will invoke the name of the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c115_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I will repay my vows to the Lord in the sight of all his people,</p>

<p><a id="c115_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> in the courts of the house of the Lord, in your midst, O Jerusalem.</p>
