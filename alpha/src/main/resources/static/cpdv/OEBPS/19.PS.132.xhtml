<h2>Psalms 132</h2>

<p><a id="c132_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Canticle in steps: of David. Behold, how good and how pleasing it is for brothers to dwell in unity.</p>

<p><a id="c132_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> It is like the ointment on the head that descended to the beard, the beard of Aaron, which descended to the hem of his garment.</p>

<p><a id="c132_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> It is like the dew of Hermon, which descended from mount Zion. For in that place, the Lord has commanded a blessing, and life, even unto eternity.</p>
