<h2>Ezra 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In the first year of Cyrus, king of the Persians, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of the Persians, so that the word of the Lord from the mouth of Jeremiah would be fulfilled. And he sent out a voice, throughout his entire kingdom, and also in writing, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> "Thus says Cyrus, the king of the Persians: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given all the kingdoms of the earth to me, and he himself has instructed me that I should build a house for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judea.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Who among you is from his entire people? May his God be with him. Let him ascend to Jerusalem, which is in Judea, and let him build the house of the Lord, the God of Israel. He is the God who is in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And let all who remain, in all the places wherever they may live, assist him, each man from his place, with silver and gold, and goods and cattle, in addition to whatever they may offer voluntarily to the temple of God, which is in Jerusalem."</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the leaders of the fathers from Judah and from Benjamin, with the priests, and the Levites, and all those whose spirit was stirred by God, rose up, so that they might ascend to build the temple of the Lord, which was in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And all those who were all around assisted their hands with vessels of silver and gold, with goods and cattle, with equipment, in addition to whatever they had offered freely.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Likewise, king Cyrus offered the vessels of the temple of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his god.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Now Cyrus, king of Persia, offered these by the hand of Mithredath, the son of the treasurer, and he counted these out to Sheshbazzar, the leader of Judah.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And this is their number: thirty gold bowls, one thousand silver bowls, twenty-nine knives, thirty gold cups,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> four hundred ten of a second kind of silver cup, one thousand other vessels.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> All the vessels of gold and silver were five thousand four hundred. Sheshbazzar brought all these, with those who ascended from the transmigration of Babylon, into Jerusalem.</p>
