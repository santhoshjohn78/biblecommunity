<h2>Psalms 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of David. When he fled from the face of his son, Absalom.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Lord, why have those who trouble me been multiplied? Many rise up against me.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Many say to my soul, "There is no salvation for him in his God."</p>

<p><a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> But you, Lord, are my supporter, my glory, and the one who raises up my head.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I have cried out to the Lord with my voice, and he has heard me from his holy mountain.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I have slept, and I have been stupefied. But I awakened because the Lord has taken me up.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I will not fear the thousands of people surrounding me. Rise up, Lord. Save me, my God.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For you have struck all those who oppose me without cause. You have broken the teeth of sinners.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Salvation is of the Lord, and your blessing is upon your people.</p>
