<h2>Psalms 60</h2>

<p><a id="c60_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unto the end. With hymns, of David.</p>

<p><a id="c60_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> O God, pay attention to my supplication. Be attentive to my prayer.</p>

<p><a id="c60_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I cried out to you from the ends of the earth. When my heart was in anguish, you exalted me on a rock. You have led me,</p>

<p><a id="c60_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> for you have been my hope, a tower of strength before the face of the enemy.</p>

<p><a id="c60_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I will dwell in your tabernacle forever. I will be protected under the cover of your wings.</p>

<p><a id="c60_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For you, my God, have listened to my prayer. You have granted an inheritance to those who fear your name.</p>

<p><a id="c60_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> You will add days to the days of the king, to his years, even to the time of generation after generation.</p>

<p><a id="c60_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He remains in eternity, in the sight of God. Who will long for his mercy and truth?</p>

<p><a id="c60_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> So I will compose a psalm to your name, forever and ever, so that I may repay my vows from day to day.</p>
