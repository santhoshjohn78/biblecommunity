<h2>Isaiah 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And you will say in that day: "I will confess to you, O Lord, because you have been angry with me; but your fury has been turned away, and you have consoled me.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Behold, God is my savior, I will act faithfully, and I will not be afraid. For the Lord is my strength and my praise, and he has become my salvation."</p>

<p><a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> You will draw water with gladness from the fountains of the Savior.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And you will say in that day: "Confess the Lord, and invoke his name! Make his plans known among the peoples! Remember that his name is exalted!</p>

<p><a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Sing to the Lord, for he has acted magnificently! Announce it to the whole world!</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Exult and give praise, O habitation of Zion! For the Great One, the Holy One of Israel, is in your midst!"</p>
