<h2>Psalms 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unto the end. For the octave. A Psalm of David.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Save me, O Lord, because holiness has passed away, because truths have been diminished, before the sons of men.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> They have been speaking emptiness, each one to his neighbor; they have been speaking with deceitful lips and a duplicitous heart.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> May the Lord scatter all deceitful lips, along with the tongue that speaks malice.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They have said: "We will magnify our tongue; our lips belong to us. What is Lord to us?"</p>

<p><a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Because of the misery of the destitute and the groaning of the poor, now I will arise, says the Lord. I will place him in safety. I will act faithfully toward him.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The eloquence of the Lord is pure eloquence, silver tested by fire, purged from the earth, refined seven times.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> You, O Lord, will preserve us, and you will guard us from this generation into eternity.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The impious wander aimlessly. According to your loftiness, you have multiplied the sons of men.</p>
