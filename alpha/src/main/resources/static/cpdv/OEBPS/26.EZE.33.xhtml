<h2>Ezekiel 33</h2>

<p><a id="c33_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c33_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> "Son of man, speak to the sons of your people, and you shall say to them: Concerning the land, when I will have led the sword over it: if the people of the land take a man, one of their least, and appoint him over themselves as a watchman,</p>

<p><a id="c33_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and if he sees the sword approaching over the land, and he sounds the trumpet, and he announces to the people,</p>

<p><a id="c33_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> then, having heard the sound of the trumpet, whoever he is, if he also does not take care of himself, and the sword arrives and takes him: his blood will be upon his own head.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He heard the sound of the trumpet, and he did not take care of himself, so his blood will be upon him. But if he guards himself, he will save his own life.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And if the watchman sees the sword approaching, and he does not sound the trumpet, and so the people do not guard themselves, and the sword arrives and takes some of their lives, certainly these have been taken due to their own iniquity. But I will attribute their blood to the hand of the watchman.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And as for you, son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore, having heard the word from my mouth, you shall announce it to them from me.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> When I say to the impious, 'O impious man, you will die a death,' if you have not spoken so that the impious man will keep himself from his way, then that impious man will die in his iniquity. But I will attribute his blood to your hand.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But if you have announced to the impious man, so that he may be converted from his ways, and he has not converted from his way, then he will die in his iniquity. Yet you will have freed your own soul.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> You, therefore, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: You have spoken in this way, saying: 'Our iniquities and our sins are upon us, and we waste away in them. So then, how would we be able to live?'</p>

<p><a id="c33_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Say to them: As I live, says the Lord God, I do not desire the death of the impious, but that the impious should convert from his way and live. Be converted, be converted from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?</p>

<p><a id="c33_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And as for you then, son of man, say to the sons of your people: The justice of the just man will not deliver him, on whatever day he will have sinned. And the impiety of the impius man will not harm him, on whatever day he will have been converted from his impiety. And the just man will not be able to live by his justice, on whatever day he will have sinned.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Even now, if I say to the just man that he shall certainly live, and so, with confidence in his justice, he commits iniquity, all his justices will be delivered into oblivion, and by his iniquity, which he has done, by this he shall die.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And if I say to the impious man, 'You shall certainly die,' and yet he repents from his sin, and he does judgment and justice,</p>

<p><a id="c33_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and if that impious man returns the collateral, and repays what he has taken by force, and if he walks in the commandments of life, and does not do anything unjust, then he shall certainly live, and he shall not die.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> None of his sins, which he has committed, will be imputed to him. He has done judgment and justice, so he shall certainly live.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the sons of your people have said, 'The way of the Lord is not a fair balance,' even while their own way is unjust.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For when the just man will have withdraw from his justice, and committed iniquities, he shall die by these.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And when the impious man will have withdrawn from his impiety, and have done judgment and justice, he shall live by these.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not right.' But I shall judge each one of you according to his own ways, O house of Israel."</p>

<p><a id="c33_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And it happened that, in the twelfth year of our transmigration, in the tenth month, on the fifth of the month, one who had fled from Jerusalem arrived saying, "The city has been laid waste."</p>

<p><a id="c33_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening, before the one who had fled arrived. And he opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning. And since my mouth had been opened, I was no longer silent.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c33_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> "Son of man, as for those who live in these ruinous ways on the soil of Israel, when speaking, they say: 'Abraham was one man, and he possessed the land as an inheritance. But we are many; the land has been given to us as a possession.'</p>

<p><a id="c33_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Therefore, you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: You who eat even the blood, and who lift up your eyes to your uncleannesses, and who shed blood: will you possess the land as an inheritance?</p>

<p><a id="c33_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> You stood by your swords, you committed abominations, and each one has defiled his neighbor's wife. And will you possess the land as an inheritance?</p>

<p><a id="c33_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> You shall say these things to them: So says the Lord God: As I live, those who live in ruinous ways will fall by the sword. And whoever is in the field will be delivered over to wild beasts to be devoured. But those who are in fortresses and in caves will die of the pestilence.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And I will make the land into a wilderness and a desert. And its arrogant strength will fail. And the mountains of Israel will be desolate; for there will be no one who crosses through them.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I will have make their land desolate and deserted, because of all their abominations, which they have worked.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And as for you, O son of man: the sons of your people speak about you beside the walls and in the doorways of houses. And they speak to one another, each man to his neighbor, saying: 'Come, and let us hear what may be the word going forth from the Lord.'</p>

<p><a id="c33_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And they come to you, as if the people were entering, and my people sit before you. And they listen to your words, but they do not do them. For they turn them into a song for their mouth, but their heart pursues their own avarice.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And you are to them like a verse set to music, which is sung with a sweet and pleasing voice. And they hear your words, but they do not do them.</p>

<p><a id="c33_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And when what has been predicted occurs, for behold it is approaching, then they shall know that a prophet was among them."</p>
