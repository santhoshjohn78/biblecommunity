<h2>Psalms 86</h2>

<p><a id="c86_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Canticle Psalm to the sons of Korah. Its foundations are in the holy mountains:</p>

<p><a id="c86_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> the Lord loves the gates of Zion above all the tabernacles of Jacob.</p>

<p><a id="c86_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Glorious things are being said of you, O City of God.</p>

<p><a id="c86_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I will be mindful of Rahab and of Babylon knowing me. Behold, the foreigners, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians: these have been there.</p>

<p><a id="c86_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Will not Zion say that this man and that man were born in her? And the Most High himself has founded her.</p>

<p><a id="c86_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The Lord will explain, in the writings of peoples and of leaders, about those who have been in her.</p>

<p><a id="c86_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For so the dwelling place within you is with all rejoicing.</p>
