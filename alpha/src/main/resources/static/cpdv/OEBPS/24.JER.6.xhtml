<h2>Jeremiah 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> "O sons of Benjamin, be strengthened in the midst of Jerusalem, and sound the trumpet in Tekoa, and lift up a banner over the house of Haccherem. For an evil has been seen from the north, with great destruction.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I have compared the daughter of Zion to a beautiful and delicate woman.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The pastors will come to her with their flocks. They have pitched their tents against her all around. Each one will feed those who are under his hand.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> 'Sanctify a war against her! Rise up together, and let us ascend at midday.' 'Woe to us! For the day has declined; for the shadows of the evening have grown longer.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> 'Rise up, and let us ascend in the night, and let us destroy her houses.' "</p>

<p><a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For thus says the Lord of hosts: "Cut down her trees, and build a rampart around Jerusalem. This is the city of visitation! Every kind of false claim is in her midst.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Just as a cistern makes its water cold, so has she made her wickedness cold. Iniquity and devastation will be heard in her; sickness and wounds will be ever before me.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> O Jerusalem, accept instruction, lest perhaps my soul may withdraw from you; lest perhaps I may set you in a desert, in an uninhabitable land."</p>

<p><a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Thus says the Lord of hosts: "They will gather the remnant of Israel, even as a single cluster of grapes is gathered from a vine. Direct your hand, as a grape-gatherer directs his hand to the basket.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> To whom should I speak, and to whom should I testify, so as to be heard? Behold, their ears are uncircumcised, and so they are unable to hear. Behold, for them, the word of the Lord has become a disgrace. And so they will not accept it.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For this reason, I have been filled with the fury of the Lord. I labor to bear it. Let it be poured out upon the child outside, or upon a group of young men meeting together. For a man will be taken captive with a woman, an elder will be taken captive with one who is full of days.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And their houses will be given over to others, with both their lands and their wives. For I will extend my hand over the inhabitants of the earth, says the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Certainly, from the least of them even to the greatest, all of them practice greed. And from the prophet even to the priest, all of them act with deceit.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And they healed the destruction of the daughter of my people with disgrace, by saying: 'Peace, peace.' And there was no peace.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> They were confounded, because they committed an abomination. Or rather, they were not confounded with shame, because they did not know how to blush. For this reason, they will fall among those who are being destroyed. In the time of their visitation, they will fall, says the Lord."</p>

<p><a id="c6_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Thus says the Lord: "Stand above the ways, and see and ask, about the ancient paths, as to which is the good way, and then walk in it. And you will find refreshment for your souls. But they said: 'We will not walk.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And I appointed watchers over you, saying: 'Listen for the sound of the trumpet.' And they said: 'We will not listen.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For this reason, hear, O Gentiles, and know, O congregation, how much I will do to them.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Hear, O earth! Behold, I will lead evils over this people, as the fruits of their own thoughts. For they have not listened to my words, and they have cast aside my law.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For what reason are you bringing me frankincense from Sheba, and sweet smelling reeds from a far away land? Your holocausts are not acceptable, and your sacrifices are not pleasing to me."</p>

<p><a id="c6_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Therefore, thus says the Lord: "Behold I will bring this people to utter ruin, and they will fall, with their fathers and sons; neighbor and relative will perish together."</p>

<p><a id="c6_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Thus says the Lord: "Behold, a people is coming from the land of the north, and a great nation will rise up from the ends of the earth.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> They will take hold of arrow and shield. They are cruel, and they will not take pity. Their voice will roar like the ocean. And they will climb upon horses, for they have been prepared like men for battle, against you, O daughter of Zion.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> 'We have heard of their fame. Our hands have become weakened. Tribulation has overtaken us, like the pains of a woman giving birth.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Do not choose to go out into the fields, and you should not walk along the roadway. For the sword and the terror of the enemy is on every side.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Wrap yourself in haircloth, O daughter of my people. And sprinkle yourself with ashes. Make a mourning for yourself, as for an only son, a bitter lamentation: 'for the destroyer will overwhelm us suddenly.'</p>

<p><a id="c6_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> I have presented you as a strong tester among my people. And you will test and know their way.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> All these leaders who are turning away and walking deceitfully, they are brass and iron; they have all been corrupted.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> The bellows has failed; the lead has been consumed by fire; the molten metal was melted to no purpose. For their wickedness has not been consumed.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Call them: 'Rejected silver.' For the Lord has cast them aside."</p>
