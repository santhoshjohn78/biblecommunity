<h2>Genesis 48</h2>

<p><a id="c48_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> After these things were done, it was reported to Joseph that his father was sick. And taking his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim, he went directly to him.</p>

<p><a id="c48_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And it was told to the old man, "Behold, your son Joseph is coming to you." And being strengthened, he sat up in bed.</p>

<p><a id="c48_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And when he had entered to him, he said: "Almighty God appeared to me at Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, and he blessed me.</p>

<p><a id="c48_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he said: 'I will increase and multiply you, and I will make you influential among the people. And I will give this land to you, and to your offspring after you, as an everlasting possession.'</p>

<p><a id="c48_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Therefore, your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came here to you, will be mine. Ephraim and Manasseh will be treated by me just like Reuben and Simeon.</p>

<p><a id="c48_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> But the remainder, whom you will conceive after them, will be yours, and they will be called by the name of their brothers among their possessions.</p>

<p><a id="c48_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> As for me, when I came from Mesopotamia, Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the very journey, and it was springtime. And I entered Ephrath and buried her next to the way of Ephrath, which by another name is called Bethlehem."</p>

<p><a id="c48_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Then, seeing his sons, he said to him: "Who are these?"</p>

<p><a id="c48_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He responded, "They are my sons, whom God gave to me as a gift in this place." "Bring them to me," he said, "so that I may bless them."</p>

<p><a id="c48_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For Israel's eyes were clouded by reason of his great age, and he was unable to see clearly. And when they were placed up against him, he kissed and embraced them.</p>

<p><a id="c48_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And he said to his son: "I have not been cheated out of seeing you. Moreover, God has shown me your offspring."</p>

<p><a id="c48_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And when Joseph had taken them from his father's lap, he reverenced prone on the ground.</p>

<p><a id="c48_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he placed Ephraim on his right, that is, towards the left hand of Israel. Yet truly Manasseh was on his left, namely, towards his father's right hand. And he placed them both up against him.</p>

<p><a id="c48_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And he, extending his right hand, placed it over the head of Ephraim, the younger brother, but the left hand was on the head of Manasseh, who was the elder, so that his hands were crossed.</p>

<p><a id="c48_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and he said: "God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, God who pastured me from my youth until the present day,</p>

<p><a id="c48_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> the Angel, who rescues me from all evils: bless these boys. And let my name be invoked over them, and also the names of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac. And may they increase into a multitude across the earth."</p>

<p><a id="c48_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> But Joseph, seeing that his father had placed his right hand over the head of Ephraim, took it gravely. And grasping his father's hand, he tried to lift it from Ephraim's head and transfer it onto the head of Manasseh.</p>

<p><a id="c48_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And he said to his father: "It should not have come to pass this way, father. For this one is the firstborn. Place your right hand over his head."</p>

<p><a id="c48_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> But refusing, he said: "I know, my son, I know. And this one, indeed, will be among the people and will be multiplied. But his younger brother will be greater than he. And his offspring will increase among the nations."</p>

<p><a id="c48_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And he blessed them at that time, saying: "In you, Israel will be blessed, and it will be said: 'May God treat you like Ephraim, and like Manasseh.' " And he established Ephraim before Manasseh.</p>

<p><a id="c48_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And he said to his son Joseph: "See, I am dying, and God will be with you, and he will lead you back to the land of your fathers.</p>

<p><a id="c48_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> I give you one part beyond that of your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow."</p>
