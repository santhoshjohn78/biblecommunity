<h2>Jeremiah 43</h2>

<p><a id="c43_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then it happened that, when Jeremiah had finished speaking all the words of the Lord their God to the people, all those words concerning which the Lord their God had sent him to them,</p>

<p><a id="c43_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Azariah, the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the exalted men, spoke to Jeremiah, saying: "You are speaking a lie! The Lord our God has not sent you to say: 'You shall not enter into Egypt so as to live in that place.'</p>

<p><a id="c43_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Instead, Baruch, the son of Neriah, has incited you against us, so as to deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, to put us to death and to cause us to be led away into Babylon."</p>

<p><a id="c43_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And so Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the leaders of the warriors, and all the people, did not heed the voice of the Lord to remain in the land of Judah.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the leaders of the warriors, took away all the remnant of Judah, who had returned from all the nations (to which they had been scattered before) to live in the land of Judah:</p>

<p><a id="c43_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> men, and women, and children, and the daughters of the king, and every soul that Nebuzaradan, the leader of the military, had left behind with Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as well as Jeremiah, the prophet, and Baruch, the son of Neriah.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And they entered into the land of Egypt. For they did not obey the voice of the Lord. And they went as far as Tahpanhes.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah at Tahpanhes, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c43_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> "Take great stones in your hand, and you shall conceal them in the crypt which is under the brick wall at the gate of the house of Pharaoh at Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send for and take Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will set his throne over these stones which I have concealed, and he will establish his throne upon them.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And he will come and strike the land of Egypt: those who are meant for death, shall go to death, and those for captivity, to captivity, and those for the sword, to the sword.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And he will kindle a fire in the shrines of the gods of Egypt, and he will burn them down, and he will lead them away captive. And he will clothe himself with the land of Egypt, just as a shepherd is clothed with his cloak. And he will go forth from that place in peace.</p>

<p><a id="c43_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he will crush the statues of the house of the Sun, those that are in the land of Egypt, and the shrines of the gods of Egypt he will burn up with fire."</p>
