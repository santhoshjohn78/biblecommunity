<h2>Ezekiel 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And he said to me: "Son of man, eat whatever you will find; eat this scroll, and, going forth, speak to the sons of Israel."</p>

<p><a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And I opened my mouth, and he fed me that scroll.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he said to me: "Son of man, your stomach shall eat, and your interior shall be filled with this scroll, which I am giving to you." And I ate it, and in my mouth it became as sweet as honey.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he said to me: "Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and you shall speak my words to them.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For you will be sent, not to a people of profound words or of an unknown language, but to the house of Israel,</p>

<p><a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and not to many peoples of profound words or of an unknown language, whose words you would not be able to understand. But if you were sent to them, they would listen to you.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Yet the house of Israel is not willing to listen to you. For they are not willing to listen to me. Certainly, the entire house of Israel has a brazen forehead and a hardened heart.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Behold, I have made your face stronger than their faces, and your forehead harder than their foreheads.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I have made your face like hardened iron and like flint. You should not fear them, and you should not have dread before their face. For they are a provoking house."</p>

<p><a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he said to me: "Son of man, listen with your ears, and take into your heart, all my words, which I am speaking to you.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And go forth and enter to those of the transmigration, to the sons of your people. And you shall speak to them. And you shall say to them: 'Thus says the Lord God.' Perhaps it may be that they will listen and be quieted."</p>

<p><a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the Spirit took me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great commotion, saying, "Blessed is the glory of the Lord from his place,"</p>

<p><a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and the voice of the wings of the living creatures striking against one another, and the voice of the wheels following the living creatures, and the voice of a great commotion.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Then the Spirit lifted me and took me away. And I went forth in bitterness, with the indignation of my spirit. For the hand of the Lord was with me, strengthening me.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And I went to those of the transmigration, to the stockpile of new crops, to those who were living beside the river Chebar. And I sat where they were sitting. And I remained there for seven days, while mourning in their midst.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Then, when seven days had passed, the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> "Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. And so, you shall listen to the word from my mouth, and you shall announce it to them from me.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> If, when I say to the impious man, 'You shall certainly die,' you do not announce it to him, and you do not speak so that he may turn aside from his impious way and live, then the same impious man will die in his iniquity. But I will attribute his blood to your hand.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> But if you announce it to the impious man, and he is not converted from his impiety and from his impious way, then indeed he will die in his iniquity. But you will have delivered your own soul.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Moreover, if the just man turns aside from his justice and commits iniquity, I will place a stumbling block before him. He shall die, because you have not announced to him. He shall die in his sin, and his justices that he did shall not be remembered. Yet truly, I will attribute his blood to your hand.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> But if you announce to the just man, so that the just man may not sin, and he does not sin, then he shall certainly live, because you have announced to him. And you will have delivered your own soul."</p>

<p><a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And the hand of the Lord was over me. And he said to me: "Rise up, and go out to the plain, and there I will speak with you."</p>

<p><a id="c3_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And I rose up, and I went out to the plain. And behold, the glory of the Lord was standing there, like the glory that I saw beside the river Chebar. And I fell upon my face.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet. And he spoke to me, and he said to me: "Enter and enclose yourself in the midst of your house.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And as for you, son of man, behold: they shall put chains upon you and bind you with them. And you shall not go out from their midst.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And I will cause your tongue to adhere to the roof of your mouth. And you will be mute, not like a man who reproaches. For they are a provoking house.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> But when I will speak to you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them: 'Thus says the Lord God.' Whoever is listening, let him hear. And whoever is quieted, let him be quieted. For they are a provoking house."</p>
