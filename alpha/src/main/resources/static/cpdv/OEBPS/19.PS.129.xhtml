<h2>Psalms 129</h2>

<p><a id="c129_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Canticle in steps. From the depths, I have cried out to you, O Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> O Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If you, O Lord, were to heed iniquities, who, O Lord, could persevere?</p>

<p><a id="c129_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For with you, there is forgiveness, and because of your law, I persevered with you, Lord. My soul has persevered in his word.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> My soul has hoped in the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> From the morning watch, even until night, let Israel hope in the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For with the Lord there is mercy, and with him there is bountiful redemption.</p>

<p><a id="c129_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.</p>
