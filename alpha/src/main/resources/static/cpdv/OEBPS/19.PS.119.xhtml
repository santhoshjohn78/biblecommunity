<h2>Psalms 119</h2>

<p><a id="c119_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Canticle in steps. When troubled, I cried out to the Lord, and he heard me.</p>

<p><a id="c119_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> O Lord, free my soul from lips of iniquity and from the deceitful tongue.</p>

<p><a id="c119_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> What will be given to you, or what will be added to you, for a deceitful tongue?:</p>

<p><a id="c119_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> the sharp arrows of the powerful, along with the burning coals of desolation.</p>

<p><a id="c119_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Woe to me, for my sojourning has been prolonged. I have lived with the inhabitants of Kedar.</p>

<p><a id="c119_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> My soul has long been a sojourner.</p>

<p><a id="c119_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> With those who hated peace, I was peaceful. When I spoke to them, they fought against me without cause.</p>
