<h2>Psalms 124</h2>

<p><a id="c124_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Canticle in steps. Those who trust in the Lord will be like the mountain of Zion. He will not be disturbed for eternity, who dwells</p>

<p><a id="c124_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> in Jerusalem. Mountains surround it. And the Lord surrounds his people, from this time forward and even forever.</p>

<p><a id="c124_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For the Lord will not allow the rod of sinners to remain over the lot of the just, so that the just may not extend their hands toward iniquity.</p>

<p><a id="c124_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Do good, O Lord, to the good and to the upright of heart.</p>

<p><a id="c124_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But those who turn away into obligation, the Lord will lead away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.</p>
