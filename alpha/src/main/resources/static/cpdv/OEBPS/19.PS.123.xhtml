<h2>Psalms 123</h2>

<p><a id="c123_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Canticle in steps. If the Lord had not been with us, let Israel now say it:</p>

<p><a id="c123_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> if the Lord had not been with us, when men rose up against us,</p>

<p><a id="c123_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> perhaps they would have swallowed us alive. When their fury was enraged against us,</p>

<p><a id="c123_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> perhaps the waters would have engulfed us.</p>

<p><a id="c123_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Our soul has passed through a torrent. Perhaps, our soul had even passed through intolerable water.</p>

<p><a id="c123_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Blessed is the Lord, who has not given us into the harm of their teeth.</p>

<p><a id="c123_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Our soul has been snatched away like a sparrow from the snare of the hunters. The snare has been broken, and we have been freed.</p>

<p><a id="c123_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</p>
