<h2>Psalms 137</h2>

<p><a id="c137_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Of David himself. O Lord, I will confess to you with my whole heart, for you have heard the words of my mouth. I will sing psalms to you in the sight of the Angels.</p>

<p><a id="c137_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I will adore before your holy temple, and I will confess your name: it is above your mercy and your truth. For you have magnified your holy name above all.</p>

<p><a id="c137_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> On whatever day that I will call upon you: hear me. You will multiply virtue in my soul.</p>

<p><a id="c137_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> May all the kings of the earth confess to you, O Lord. For they have heard all the words of your mouth.</p>

<p><a id="c137_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And let them sing in accordance with the ways of the Lord. For great is the glory of the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c137_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For the Lord is exalted, and he looks with favor on the humble. But the lofty he knows from a distance.</p>

<p><a id="c137_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> If I wander into the midst of tribulation, you will revive me. For you extended your hand against the wrath of my enemies. And your right hand has accomplished my salvation.</p>

<p><a id="c137_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The Lord will provide retribution on my behalf. O Lord, your mercy is forever. Do not disdain the works of your hands.</p>
