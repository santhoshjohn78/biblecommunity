<h2>Psalms 125</h2>

<p><a id="c125_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Canticle in steps. When the Lord turned back the captivity of Zion, we became like those who are consoled.</p>

<p><a id="c125_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Then our mouth was filled with gladness and our tongue with exultation. Then they will say among the nations: "The Lord has done great things for them."</p>

<p><a id="c125_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The Lord has done great things for us. We have become joyful.</p>

<p><a id="c125_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Convert our captivity, O Lord, like a torrent in the south.</p>

<p><a id="c125_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Those who sow in tears shall reap in exultation.</p>

<p><a id="c125_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> When departing, they went forth and wept, sowing their seeds.</p>

<p><a id="c125_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But when returning, they will arrive with exultation, carrying their sheaves.</p>
