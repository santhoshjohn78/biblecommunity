<h2>Psalms 110</h2>

<p><a id="c110_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Alleluia. I will confess to you, O Lord, with my whole heart, in the council of the just and in the congregation.</p>

<p><a id="c110_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Great are the works of the Lord, exquisite in all his intentions.</p>

<p><a id="c110_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Confession and magnificence are his work. And his justice remains from age to age.</p>

<p><a id="c110_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He has created a memorial to his wonders; he is a merciful and compassionate Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c110_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He has given food to those who fear him. He will be mindful of his covenant in every age.</p>

<p><a id="c110_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He will announce the virtue of his works to his people,</p>

<p><a id="c110_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> so that he may give them the inheritance of the nations. The works of his hands are truth and judgment.</p>

<p><a id="c110_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> All his commands are faithful: confirmed from age to age, created in truth and fairness.</p>

<p><a id="c110_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He has sent redemption upon his people. He has commanded his covenant for all eternity. Holy and terrible is his name.</p>

<p><a id="c110_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. A good understanding is for all who do it. His praise remains from age to age.</p>
