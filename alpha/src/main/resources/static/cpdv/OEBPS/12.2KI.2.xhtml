<h2>2 Kings 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Now it happened that, when the Lord willed to lift up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were going out of Gilgal.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Elijah said to Elisha: "Remain here. For the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel." And Elisha said to him, "As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not forsake you." And when they had descended to Bethel,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> the sons of the prophets, who were at Bethel, went out to Elisha. And they said to him, "Do you not know that today the Lord will take away your lord from you?" And he responded: "I know it. Be silent."</p>

<p><a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then Elijah said to Elisha: "Remain here. For the Lord has sent me to Jericho." And he said, "As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not forsake you." And when they had arrived at Jericho,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> the sons of the prophets, who were at Jericho, drew near to Elisha. And they said to him, "Do you not know that today the Lord will take away your lord from you?" And he said: "I know it. Be silent."</p>

<p><a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Then Elijah said to him: "Remain here. For the Lord has sent me as far as the Jordan." And he said, "As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not forsake you." And so, the two of them continued on together.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And fifty men from the sons of the prophets followed them, and they stood opposite them, at a distance. But the two of them were standing above the Jordan.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Elijah took his cloak, and he rolled it up, and he struck the waters, which were divided into two parts. And they both went across on dry ground.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And when they had gone across, Elijah said to Elisha, "Ask what you wish that I may do for you, before I am taken from you." And Elisha said, "I beg you, that twice your spirit may be accomplished in me."</p>

<p><a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he responded: "You have requested a difficult thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, you will have what you requested. But if you do not see, it shall not be."</p>

<p><a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And as they continued on, they were conversing while walking. And behold, a fiery chariot with fiery horses divided the two. And Elijah ascended by a whirlwind into heaven.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Then Elisha saw it, and he cried out: "My father, my father! The chariot of Israel with its driver!" And he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own garments, and he tore them into two parts.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he picked up the cloak of Elijah, which had fallen from him. And turning back, he stood above the bank of the Jordan.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And he struck the waters with the cloak of Elijah, which had fallen from him, and they were not divided. And he said, "Where is the God of Elijah, even now?" And he struck the waters, and they were divided here and there. And Elisha went across.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Then the sons of the prophets, who were at Jericho, watching from a distance, said, "The spirit of Elijah has rested upon Elisha." And approaching to meet him, they reverenced him prone on the ground.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And they said to him, "Behold, with your servants there are fifty strong men, who are able to go forth and to seek your lord. For perhaps, the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley." But he said, "Do not send them."</p>

<p><a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And they urged him, until he acquiesced and said, "Send them." And they sent fifty men. And after they had searched for three days, they did not find him.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And they returned to him, for he was living in Jericho. And he said to them: "Did I not say to you, 'Do not send them?' "</p>

<p><a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Also, the men of the city said to Elisha: "Behold, this city is a very good habitation, as you yourself perceive, O lord. But the waters are very bad, and the ground is barren."</p>

<p><a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And so he said, "Bring a new vessel to me, and place salt in it." And when they had brought it,</p>

<p><a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> he went out to the source of the waters, and he cast the salt into it. And he said: "Thus says the Lord: I have healed these waters, and no longer shall there be death or barrenness in them."</p>

<p><a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Then the waters were healed, even to this day, in accord with the word of Elisha, which he spoke.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Then he went up from there into Bethel. And as he was ascending along the way, little boys departed from the city. And they were mocking him, saying: "Go up, bald head! Go up, bald head!"</p>

<p><a id="c2_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And when he had looked back, he saw them, and he cursed them in the name of the Lord. And two bears went out from the forest, and they wounded forty-two boys among them.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Then he went away from there to mount Carmel. And he returned from there into Samaria.</p>
