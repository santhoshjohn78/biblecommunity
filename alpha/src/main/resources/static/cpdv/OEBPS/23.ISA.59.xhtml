<h2>Isaiah 59</h2>

<p><a id="c59_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Behold, the hand of the Lord has not been shortened, so that it cannot save, and his ear has not been blocked, so that it cannot hear.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> But your iniquities have made a division between you and your God, and your sins have concealed his face from you, so that he would not hear.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For your hands have been polluted by blood, and your fingers by iniquity. Your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue utters iniquity.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> There is no one who calls for justice, and there is no one who judges truly. For they trust in nothing, and they speak emptiness. They have conceived hardship, and they have given birth to iniquity.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They have ruptured the eggs of asps, and they have woven the webs of spiders. Whoever will eat of their eggs will die. For what has been incubated will hatch into a king snake.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Their weavings will not be for clothing, nor will they cover themselves with their handiwork. Their works are useless things, and the work of iniquity is in their hands.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Their feet run to evil, and they rush to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are useless thoughts; devastation and destruction are in their ways.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> They have not known the way of peace, and there is no judgment in their steps. Their paths have become crooked for them. Anyone who treads in them knows no peace.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Because of this, judgment is far from us, and justice will not take hold of us. We waited for light, and behold, darkness; we waited for brightness, and we walked in darkness.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> We groped for the wall, like one who is blind, and we felt our way, like one without eyes. We stumbled at midday, as if in darkness; and in darkness, as if in death.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> We will all roar like bears, and we will sigh like despondent doves. We hoped for judgment, and there is none; for salvation, and it is far from us.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For our iniquities have been multiplied in your sight, and our sins have answered us. For our wickedness is with us, and we have acknowledged our iniquities:</p>

<p><a id="c59_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> sinning and lying against the Lord. And we have turned away, not so as to go after our God, and so that we were speaking calumny and transgression. We have conceived, and spoken from the heart, words of falsehood.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And judgment has been turned backwards, and justice has stood far away. For truth has fallen down in the street, and fairness was not able to enter.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the truth has gone into oblivion. And he who withdraws from evil endures plunder. And the Lord saw this, and it seemed evil in his eyes. For there is no judgment.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he saw that there was no good man. And he was astonished that there was no one to meet him. And his own arm brought salvation to him, and his own justice strengthened him.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He clothed himself with justice as with a breastplate, and with a helmet of salvation upon his head. He put on the vestments of vengeance, and he was covered with zeal as with a cloak.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> This was for vindication, as a repayment of indignation to his adversaries, and as a sudden reversal for his enemies. He will repay the islands in their turn.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And those from the west will fear the name of the Lord, and those from the rising of the sun will fear his glory, when he arrives like a violent river, which the Spirit of the Lord urges on.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And the Redeemer will arrive in Zion, and to those who return from the iniquity within Jacob, says the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c59_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> This is my pact with them, says the Lord. My Spirit is within you, and my words, which I have put in your mouth, will not withdraw from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your offspring, nor from the mouth of your offspring's offspring, says the Lord, from this moment, and even forever.</p>
