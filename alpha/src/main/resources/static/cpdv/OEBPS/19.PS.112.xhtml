<h2>Psalms 112</h2>

<p><a id="c112_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Alleluia. Praise the Lord, children. Praise the name of the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Blessed is the name of the Lord, from this time forward and even forever.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> From the rising of the sun, even to its setting, praiseworthy is the name of the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory is high above the heavens.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Who is like the Lord, our God, who dwells on high,</p>

<p><a id="c112_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and who gazes upon the humble things in heaven and on earth?</p>

<p><a id="c112_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He lifts up the needy from the ground, and he urges the poor away from filth,</p>

<p><a id="c112_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> so that he may place him with the leaders, with the leaders of his people.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He causes a barren woman to live in a house, as the joyful mother of sons.</p>
