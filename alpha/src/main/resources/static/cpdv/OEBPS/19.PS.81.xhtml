<h2>Psalms 81</h2>

<p><a id="c81_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of Asaph. God has stood in the synagogue of gods, but, in their midst, he decides between gods.</p>

<p><a id="c81_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> How long will you judge unjustly and favor the faces of sinners?</p>

<p><a id="c81_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Judge for the indigent and the orphan. Do justice to the humble and the poor.</p>

<p><a id="c81_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Rescue the poor, and free the needy from the hand of the sinner.</p>

<p><a id="c81_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They did not know and did not understand. They wander in darkness. All the foundations of the earth will be moved.</p>

<p><a id="c81_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I said: You are gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High.</p>

<p><a id="c81_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But you will die like men, and you will fall just like one of the princes.</p>

<p><a id="c81_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Rise up, O God. Judge the earth. For you will inherit it with all the nations.</p>
