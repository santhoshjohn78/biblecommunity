<h2>Nahum 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> He ascends, who would scatter before your eyes, who would maintain the blockade. Contemplate the way, fortify your back, reinforce virtue greatly.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For the Lord has repaid the arrogance of Jacob, just like the arrogance of Israel. For the despoilers have scattered them, and they have corrupted their procreation.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The shield of his strong ones is fire, the men of war are in scarlet. The reins of the chariot are fiery in the day of his preparation, and the drivers have been drugged.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> They have become confused on their journey. The four-horse chariots have collided in the streets. Their appearance is like torches, like lightning dashing around.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He will call to mind his strong ones; they will destroy along their journey. They will quickly ascend its walls, and a shelter will be prepared.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The gates of the rivers have been opened, and the temple has been pulled down to the ground.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the foot soldier has been led away captive, and her handmaids were driven away, mourning like doves, murmuring in their hearts.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Nineveh, her waters are like a fish pond. Yet truly, they have fled away: "Stand, stand!" But there is no one who will turn back.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Despoil the silver, despoil the gold. And there is no end to all the riches of desirable equipment.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> She has been scattered, and cut, and torn apart. And the heart melts, and the knees buckle, and weakness is in every temperament. And the faces of them all are like a black kettle.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Where is the dwelling place of the lions, and the feeding ground of the young lions, to which the lion went, so as to open a way for the young lion, and so that there would be none to make them afraid?</p>

<p><a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The lion seized enough for his young, and killed enough for his lionesses, and he filled his caves with prey, and his den with spoils.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Behold, I will come to you, says the Lord of hosts, and I will burn your chariots even to smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. And I will exterminate your prey from the land, and the voice of your messengers shall no longer be heard.</p>
