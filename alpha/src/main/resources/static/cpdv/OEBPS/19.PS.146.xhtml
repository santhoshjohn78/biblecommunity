<h2>Psalms 146</h2>

<p><a id="c146_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Alleluia. Praise the Lord, because the psalm is good. Delightful and beautiful praise shall be for our God.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The Lord builds up Jerusalem. He will gather together the dispersed of Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He heals the contrite of heart, and he binds up their sorrows.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He numbers the multitude of the stars, and he calls them all by their names.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Great is our Lord, and great is his virtue. And of his wisdom, there is no number.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The Lord lifts up the meek, but he brings down the sinner, even to the ground.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Sing before the Lord with confession. Play psalms to our God on a stringed instrument.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He covers heaven with clouds, and he prepares rain for the earth. He produces grass on the mountains and herbs for the service of men.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He gives their food to beasts of burden and to young ravens that call upon him.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> He will not have good will for the strength of the horse, nor will he be well pleased with the legs of a man.</p>

<p><a id="c146_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The Lord is well pleased with those who fear him and with those who hope in his mercy.</p>
