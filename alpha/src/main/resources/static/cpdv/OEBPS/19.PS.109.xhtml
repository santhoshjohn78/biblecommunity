<h2>Psalms 109</h2>

<p><a id="c109_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of David. The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool."</p>

<p><a id="c109_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The Lord will send forth the scepter of your virtue from Zion. Rule in the midst of your enemies.</p>

<p><a id="c109_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> It is with you from the beginning, in the day of your virtue, in the splendor of the saints. From conception, before the light-bearer, I begot you.</p>

<p><a id="c109_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The Lord has sworn, and he will not repent: "You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek."</p>

<p><a id="c109_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The Lord is at your right hand. He has broken kings in the day of his wrath.</p>

<p><a id="c109_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He will judge between the nations; he will fill up ruination. He will shatter heads in the land of the many.</p>

<p><a id="c109_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He will drink from the torrent on the way. Because of this, he will exalt the head.</p>
