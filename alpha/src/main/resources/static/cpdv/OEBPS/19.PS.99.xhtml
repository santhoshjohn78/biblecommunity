<h2>Psalms 99</h2>

<p><a id="c99_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of Confession.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Shout joyfully to God, all the earth. Serve the Lord with rejoicing. Enter into his sight in exultation.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Know that the Lord himself is God. He made us, and we ourselves did not. We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Enter his gates with confession, his courts with hymns, and acknowledge him. Praise his name.</p>

<p><a id="c99_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For the Lord is sweet, his mercy is in eternity, and his truth is from generation to generation.</p>
