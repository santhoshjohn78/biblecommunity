<h2>Revelation 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> After these things, I saw, and behold, a door was opened in heaven, and the voice that I heard speaking with me first was like a trumpet, saying: "Ascend to here, and I will reveal to you what must occur after these things."</p>

<p><a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And immediately I was in the Spirit. And behold, a throne had been placed in heaven, and there was One sitting upon the throne.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the One who was sitting there was similar in appearance to a stone of jasper and sardius. And there was an iridescence surrounding the throne, in aspect similar to an emerald.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And surrounding the throne were twenty-four smaller thrones. And upon the thrones, twenty-four elders were sitting, clothed entirely in white vestments, and on their heads were gold crowns.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And from the throne, lightnings and voices and thunders went forth. And there were seven burning lamps before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And in view of the throne, there was something that seemed like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. And in the middle of the throne, and all around the throne, there were four living creatures, full of eyes in front and in back.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the first living creature resembled a lion, and the second living creature resembled a calf, and the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature resembled a flying eagle.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And each of the four living creatures had upon them six wings, and all around and within they are full of eyes. And they took no rest, day or night, from saying: "Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come."</p>

<p><a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And while those living creatures were giving glory and honor and blessings to the One sitting upon the throne, who lives forever and ever,</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> the twenty-four elders fell prostrate before the One sitting upon the throne, and they adored him who lives forever and ever, and they cast their crowns before the throne, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> "You are worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory and honor and power. For you have created all things, and they became and were created because of your will."</p>
