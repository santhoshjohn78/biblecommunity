<h2>Psalms 97</h2>

<p><a id="c97_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of David himself. Sing to the Lord a new song, for he has performed wonders. His right hand has accomplished salvation for him, with his holy arm.</p>

<p><a id="c97_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The Lord has made known his salvation. He has revealed his justice in the sight of the nations.</p>

<p><a id="c97_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He has remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>

<p><a id="c97_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Sing joyfully to God, all the earth. Sing and exult, and sing psalms.</p>

<p><a id="c97_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Sing psalms to the Lord with stringed instruments, with strings and the voice of a psalmist,</p>

<p><a id="c97_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> with subtle wind instruments and the voice of woodwinds. Make a joyful noise before the Lord our king.</p>

<p><a id="c97_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Let the sea be moved and all its fullness, the whole world and all who dwell in it.</p>

<p><a id="c97_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The rivers will clap their hands, the mountains will exult together,</p>

<p><a id="c97_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> before the presence of the Lord. For he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the whole world with justice, and the peoples with fairness.</p>
