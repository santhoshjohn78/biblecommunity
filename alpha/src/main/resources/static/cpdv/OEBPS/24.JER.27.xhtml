<h2>Jeremiah 27</h2>

<p><a id="c27_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c27_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> "Thus says the Lord to me: Make bands and chains for yourself. And you shall place them on your neck.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And you shall send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the sons of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who came to Jerusalem, to Zedekiah, the king of Judah.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And you shall instruct them to say to their masters: Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: You shall say these things to your masters:</p>

<p><a id="c27_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I made the earth, and the men and beasts which are upon the face of the earth, by my great strength and by my outstretched arm. And I have given it to whomever it was pleasing in my eyes.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And now, therefore, I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant. Moreover, I have given to him also the beasts of the field, so that they may serve him.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And all the nations will serve him, and his son, and his son's son. Many nations and great kings will serve him, until the time arrives for him and his land.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But the nation or kingdom that will not serve Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and whoever will not bend his neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will visit upon that nation with the sword, and with famine, and with pestilence, says the Lord, until I consume them by his hand.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Therefore, you should not choose to listen to your own prophets, and diviners, and dreamers, and soothsayers, and sorcerers, who say to you: 'You shall not serve the king of Babylon.'</p>

<p><a id="c27_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For they prophesy lies to you, so that they may cause you to be far from your own country, and may cast you out, and may cause you to perish.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Furthermore, the nation which will bend its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and which will serve him, I will permit them to remain in their own land, says the Lord. And they will cultivate it, and they will live in it."</p>

<p><a id="c27_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I spoke to Zedekiah, the king of Judah, according to all these words, saying: "Subject your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and you will live.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Why should you suffer death, you and your people, by the sword, and famine, and pestilence, just as the Lord has spoken against any nation that refuses to serve the king of Babylon?</p>

<p><a id="c27_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Do not choose to listen to the words of the prophets, saying to you: 'You will not serve the king of Babylon.' For they are speaking a lie to you.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For I have not sent them, says the Lord. And they prophesy falsely in my name, so that they may cast you out, and so that you may perish, both you and the prophets who make predictions for you."</p>

<p><a id="c27_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> I spoke also to the priests and to this people, saying: "Thus says the Lord: Do not choose to listen to the words of your prophets, who prophesy to you, saying: 'Behold, the vessels of the Lord will now quickly be returned from Babylon.' For they are prophesying to you a lie.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Therefore, do not choose to listen to them, but instead, serve the king of Babylon, so that you may live. Why should this city be given over into desolation?</p>

<p><a id="c27_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> But if they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is in them, then let them intercede before the Lord of hosts, so that the vessels that were left behind in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, may not go to Babylon.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For thus says the Lord of hosts to the pillars, and to the sea of brass, and to the bases, and to the remainder of the vessels that have been left behind in this city,</p>

<p><a id="c27_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> which Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, did not take when he carried away Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, from Jerusalem into Babylon, with all the nobility of Judah and Jerusalem:</p>

<p><a id="c27_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to the vessels that were left behind in the house of the Lord and in the house of the king of Judah and Jerusalem:</p>

<p><a id="c27_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> They shall be carried away to Babylon, and there they shall be, until the day of their visitation, says the Lord. And then I will cause them to be carried back, and to be restored to this place.</p>
