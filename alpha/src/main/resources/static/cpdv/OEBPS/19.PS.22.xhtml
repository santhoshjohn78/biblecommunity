<h2>Psalms 22</h2>

<p><a id="c22_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of David. The Lord directs me, and nothing will be lacking to me.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> He has settled me here, in a place of pasture. He has led me out to the water of refreshment.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He has converted my soul. He has led me away on the paths of justice, for the sake of his name.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For, even if I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evils. For you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they have given me consolation.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> You have prepared a table in my sight, opposite those who trouble me. You have anointed my head with oil, and my cup, which inebriates me, how brilliant it is!</p>

<p><a id="c22_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And your mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and so may I dwell in the house of the Lord for length of days.</p>
