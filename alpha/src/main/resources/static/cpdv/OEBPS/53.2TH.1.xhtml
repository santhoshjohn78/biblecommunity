<h2>2 Thessalonians 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians, in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Grace and peace to you, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> We ought to give thanks always to God for you, brothers, in a fitting manner, because your faith is increasing greatly, and because the charity of each of you toward one another is abundant,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> so much so that we ourselves even glory in you among the churches of God, because of your patience and faith in all of your persecutions and tribulations that you endure,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> which are a sign of the just judgment of God, so that you may be held worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For certainly, it is just for God to repay trouble to those who trouble you,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and to repay you, who are being troubled, with a repose with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with the Angels of his virtue,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> granting vindication, by a flame of fire, against those who do not know God and who are not obedient to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> These shall be given the eternal punishment of destruction, apart from the face of the Lord and apart from the glory of his virtue,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> when he arrives to be glorified in his saints, and to become a wonder in all those who have believed, in that day, because our testimony has been believed by you.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Because of this, too, we pray always for you, so that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may complete every act of his goodness, as well as his work of faith in virtue,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> in order that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, in accord with the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
