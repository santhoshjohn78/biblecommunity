<h2>1 Samuel 29</h2>

<p><a id="c29_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Then all the troops of the Philistines were gathered together at Aphek. But Israel also made camp, above the spring which is in Jezreel.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And indeed, the princes of the Philistines advanced by hundreds and by thousands; but David and his men were in the rear with Achish.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the leaders of the Philistines said to Achish, "What do these Hebrews intend to do?" And Achish said to the leaders of the Philistines: "Could you be ignorant about David, who was the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, and who has been with me for many days, even years, and I have not found within him anything, from the day that he fled to me, even to this day?"</p>

<p><a id="c29_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then the leaders of the Philistines became angry against him, and they said to him: "Let this man return, and let him settle in his place, which you appointed for him. But let him not descend with us to battle, lest he become an adversary to us when we begin to fight. For in what other way will he be able to please his lord, except with our heads?</p>

<p><a id="c29_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Is not this the David, about whom they were singing, while dancing, saying: 'Saul struck down his thousands, but David his ten thousands?' "</p>

<p><a id="c29_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Therefore, Achish called David, and he said to him: "As the Lord lives, you are good and righteous in my sight, even in your departure and your return with me in the military camp. And I have not found anything evil in you, from the day that you came to me, even to this day. But you are not pleasing to the princes.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Therefore, return, and go in peace, so that you do not offend the eyes of the princes of the Philistines."</p>

<p><a id="c29_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And David said to Achish, "But what have I done, or what have you found in me, your servant, from the day that I was in your sight to this day, so that I may not go out and fight against the enemies of my lord, the king?"</p>

<p><a id="c29_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And in response, Achish said to David: "I know that you are good in my sight, like an angel of God. But the leaders of the Philistines have said: 'He shall not go up with us to the battle.'</p>

<p><a id="c29_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And so, rise up in the morning, you and the servants of your lord who came with you. And when you have risen up in the night, as it begins to be light, go forth."</p>

<p><a id="c29_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And so David rose up in the night, he and his men, so that they might set out in the morning. And they returned to the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines ascended to Jezreel.</p>
