<h2>Psalms 120</h2>

<p><a id="c120_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Canticle in steps. I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains; from thence help will come to me.</p>

<p><a id="c120_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</p>

<p><a id="c120_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> May he not allow your foot to be moved, and may he not slumber, who guards you.</p>

<p><a id="c120_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Behold, he who guards Israel will neither sleep, nor slumber.</p>

<p><a id="c120_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The Lord is your keeper, the Lord is your protection, above your right hand.</p>

<p><a id="c120_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The sun will not burn you by day, nor the moon by night.</p>

<p><a id="c120_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The Lord guards you from all evil. May the Lord guard your soul.</p>

<p><a id="c120_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> May the Lord guard your entrance and your exit, from this time forward and even forever.</p>
