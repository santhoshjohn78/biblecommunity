<h2>Psalms 121</h2>

<p><a id="c121_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Canticle in steps. I rejoiced in the things that were said to me: "We shall go into the house of the Lord."</p>

<p><a id="c121_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Our feet were standing in your courts, O Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a id="c121_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jerusalem has been built as a city, whose participation is unto itself.</p>

<p><a id="c121_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For to that place, the tribes ascended, the tribes of the Lord: the testimony of Israel, to confess to the name of the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c121_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For in that place, seats have sat down in judgment, seats above the house of David.</p>

<p><a id="c121_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Petition for the things that are for the peace of Jerusalem, and for abundance for those who love you.</p>

<p><a id="c121_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Let peace be in your virtue, and abundance in your towers.</p>

<p><a id="c121_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For the sake of my brothers and my neighbors, I spoke peace about you.</p>

<p><a id="c121_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I sought good things for you.</p>
