<h2>Psalms 149</h2>

<p><a id="c149_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Alleluia. Sing to the Lord a new song. His praise is in the Church of the saints.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let Israel rejoice in him who made them, and let the sons of Zion exult in their king.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Let them praise his name in chorus. Let them sing psalms to him with the timbrel and the psaltery.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For the Lord is well pleased with his people, and he will exalt the meek unto salvation.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The saints will exult in glory. They will rejoice upon their couches.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The exultations of God will be in their throat, and two-edged swords will be in their hands:</p>

<p><a id="c149_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> to obtain vindication among the nations, chastisements among the peoples,</p>

<p><a id="c149_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> to bind their kings with shackles and their nobles with manacles of iron,</p>

<p><a id="c149_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> to obtain judgment over them, as it has been written. This is glory for all his saints. Alleluia.</p>
