<h2>Psalms 126</h2>

<p><a id="c126_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Canticle in steps: of Solomon. Unless the Lord has built the house, those who build it have labored in vain. Unless the Lord has guarded the city, he who guards it watches in vain.</p>

<p><a id="c126_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> It is in vain that you rise before daylight, that you rise up after you have sat down, you who chew the bread of sorrow. Whereas, to his beloved, he will give sleep.</p>

<p><a id="c126_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Behold, the inheritance of the Lord is sons, the reward is the fruit of the womb.</p>

<p><a id="c126_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Like arrows in the hand of the powerful, so are the sons of those who have been cast out.</p>

<p><a id="c126_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Blessed is the man who has filled his desire from these things. He will not be confounded when he speaks to his enemies at the gate.</p>
