<h2>Zechariah 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the word of the Lord of hosts came, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thus says the Lord of hosts: I have been zealous for Zion with a great zeal, and with a great indignation have I been zealous for her.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thus says the Lord of hosts: I have been turned back towards Zion, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem will be called: "The City of Truth," and "The Mountain of the Lord of Hosts, the Sanctified Mountain."</p>

<p><a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thus says the Lord of hosts: Then elderly men and elderly women will dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man will be with his walking stick in his hand, because of the multitude of days.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the streets of the city will be filled with toddlers and children, playing in its streets.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thus says the Lord of hosts: If it seems difficult in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, could it indeed be difficult in my eyes, says the Lord of hosts?</p>

<p><a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the land of the East, and from the land of the setting of the sun.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I will lead them, and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in justice.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Thus says the Lord of hosts: Let your hands be strengthened, you who, in those days, are listening to these words by the mouth of the prophets, in the day that the house of the Lord of hosts has been founded, so that the temple may be built.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Indeed, before those days, there was no pay for men, nor was there pay for beasts of burden, and neither was there peace for those entering, nor for those exiting, because of the tribulation. And I had dismissed all men, each one against his neighbor.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But now, I will not act towards the remnant of this people according to the former days, says the Lord of hosts.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But there will be a seed of peace: the vine will give her fruit, and the earth will give her seedlings, and the heavens will give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And this shall be: just as you were a curse among the Gentiles, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid. Let your hands be strengthened.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For thus says the Lord of hosts: Just as I intended to afflict you, when your fathers had provoked me to wrath, says the Lord,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and I did not show mercy, so have I turned back, thinking in these days to do good to the house of Judah and to Jerusalem. Do not be afraid.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Therefore, these are the words that you shall do: Speak the truth, each one to his neighbor. With truth and a judgment of peace, judge at your gates.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And let not anyone think up evil against his friend in your hearts. And do not choose to swear falsely. For all these are things that I hate, says the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c8_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Thus says the Lord of hosts: The fast of the fourth, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth will be for the house of Judah in joy and gladness and with bright solemnities. So then, love truth and peace.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Thus says the Lord of hosts, then the people may arrive and dwell in many cities,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and the inhabitants may hurry, one saying to another: "Let us go and entreat the face of the Lord, and let us seek the Lord of hosts. I will go also."</p>

<p><a id="c8_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And many peoples and strong nations will approach, seeking the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the face of the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Thus says the Lord of hosts: In those days, then, ten men from every language of the Gentiles will grasp and cling to the hem of one man of Judea, saying: "We will go with you. For we have heard that God is with you."</p>
