<h2>Psalms 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unto the end. A Psalm of David. How long, O Lord? Will you forget me until the end? How long will you turn your face away from me?</p>

<p><a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> How long can I take counsel in my soul, sorrowing in my heart throughout the day?</p>

<p><a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> How long will my enemy be exalted over me?</p>

<p><a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Look upon me and listen to me, O Lord my God. Enlighten my eyes, lest I fall asleep forever in death,</p>

<p><a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> lest at any time my enemy may say, "I have prevailed against him." Those who trouble me will exult, if I have been disturbed.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> But I have hoped in your mercy. My heart will exult in your salvation. I will sing to the Lord, who assigns good things to me. And I will sing psalms to the name of the Lord Most High.</p>
