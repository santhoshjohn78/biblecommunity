<h2>Psalms 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unto the end. For the oil and wine presses. A Psalm of David.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is your name throughout all the earth! For your magnificence is elevated above the heavens.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Out of the mouths of babes and infants, you have perfected praise, because of your enemies, so that you may destroy the enemy and the revenger.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For I will behold your heavens, the works of your fingers: the moon and the stars, which you have founded.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> What is man, that you are mindful of him, or the son of man, that you visit him?</p>

<p><a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> You reduced him to a little less than the Angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and you have set him over the works of your hands.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> You have subjected all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen, and in addition: the beasts of the field,</p>

<p><a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, which pass through the paths of the sea.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is your name throughout all the earth!</p>
