<h2>Ezekiel 18</h2>

<p><a id="c18_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c18_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> "Why is it that you circulate among yourselves this parable, as a proverb in the land of Israel, saying: 'The fathers ate a bitter grape, and the teeth of the sons have been affected.'</p>

<p><a id="c18_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> As I live, says the Lord God, this parable shall no longer be a proverb for you in Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Behold, all souls are mine. Just as the soul of the father is mine, so also is the soul of the son. The soul that sins, the same shall die.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And if a man is just, and he accomplishes judgment and justice,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and if he does not eat upon the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and if he has not violated the wife of his neighbor, nor approached a menstruating woman,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and if he has not grieved any man, but has restored the collateral to the debtor, if he has seized nothing by violence, has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> if he has not lent upon usury, nor taken any increase, if he has averted his hand from iniquity, and has executed true judgment between man and man,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> if he has walked in my precepts and kept my judgments, so that he acts in accord with truth, then he is just; he shall certainly live, says the Lord God.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But if he raises a son who is a robber, who sheds blood, and who does any of these things,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> (even though he himself does not do any of these things,) and who eats upon the mountains, and who defiles the wife of his neighbor,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> who grieves the needy and the poor, who seizes with violence, who does not restore the collateral, and who lifts up his eyes to idols, committing abomination,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> who lends upon usury, and who takes an increase, then shall he live? He shall not live. Since he has done all these detestable things, he shall certainly die. His blood shall be upon him.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But if he raises a son, who, seeing all his father's sins that he has done, is afraid and so does not act in a way similar to him,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> who does not eat upon the mountains, nor lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and who does not violate the wife of his neighbor,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and who has not grieved any man, nor withheld the collateral, nor seized by violence, but instead has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment,</p>

<p><a id="c18_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> who has averted his hand from injuring the poor, who has not taken usury and an overabundance, who has acted according to my judgments and walked in my precepts, then this one shall not die for the iniquity of his father; instead, he shall certainly live.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> As for his father, because he oppressed and did violence to his brother, and worked evil in the midst of his people, behold, he has died by his own iniquity.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And you say, 'Why has not the son borne the iniquity of the father?' Clearly, since the son has worked judgment and justice, has observed all my precepts, and has done them, he shall certainly live.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> The soul that sins, the same shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son. The justice of the just man shall be upon himself, but the impiety of the impious man shall be upon himself.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> But if the impious man does penance for all his sins which he has committed, and if he keeps all my precepts, and accomplishes judgment and justice, then he shall certainly live, and he shall not die.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> I will not remember all his iniquities, which he has worked; by his justice, which he has worked, he shall live.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> How could it be my will that an impious man should die, says the Lord God, and not that he should be converted from his ways and live?</p>

<p><a id="c18_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> But if a just man turns himself away from his justice, and does iniquity in accord with all the abominations that the impious man so often does, why should he live? All his justices, which he has accomplished, shall not be remembered. By the transgression, in which he has transgressed, and by his sin, in which he has sinned, by these he shall die.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And you have said, 'The way of the Lord is not fair.' Therefore, listen, O house of Israel. How could it be that my way is not fair? And is it not instead your ways that are perverse?</p>

<p><a id="c18_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For when the just man turns himself away from his justice, and commits iniquity, he shall die by this; by the injustice that he has worked, he shall die.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And when the impious man turns himself away from his impiety, which he has done, and accomplishes judgment and justice, he shall cause his own soul to live.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> For by considering and turning himself away from all his iniquities, which he has worked, he shall certainly live, and he shall not die.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And yet the sons of Israel say, 'The way of the Lord is not fair.' How could it be that my ways are not fair, O house of Israel? And is it not instead your ways that are perverse?</p>

<p><a id="c18_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Therefore, O house of Israel, I will judge each one according to his ways, says the Lord God. Be converted, and do penance for all your iniquities, and then iniquity will not be your ruin.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Cast all your transgressions, by which you have transgressed, away from you, and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. And then why should you die, O house of Israel?</p>

<p><a id="c18_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> For I do not desire the death of one who dies, says the Lord God. So return and live."</p>
