<h2>Psalms 145</h2>

<p><a id="c145_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Alleluia. Of Haggai and Zachariah.</p>

<p><a id="c145_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Praise the Lord, O my soul. I will praise the Lord with my life. I will sing psalms to my God as long as I shall be. Do not trust in the leaders,</p>

<p><a id="c145_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> in the sons of men, in whom there is no salvation.</p>

<p><a id="c145_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> His spirit will depart, and he will return to his earth. In that day, all their thoughts will perish.</p>

<p><a id="c145_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob: his hope is in the Lord God himself,</p>

<p><a id="c145_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all the things that are in them.</p>

<p><a id="c145_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He preserves the truth forever. He executes judgment for those who suffer injury. He provides food for the hungry. The Lord releases those who are bound.</p>

<p><a id="c145_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The Lord enlightens the blind. The Lord sets upright those who have been thrown down. The Lord loves the just.</p>

<p><a id="c145_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The Lord watches over new arrivals. He will support the orphan and the widow. And he will destroy the ways of sinners.</p>

<p><a id="c145_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The Lord shall reign forever: your God, O Zion, from generation to generation.</p>
