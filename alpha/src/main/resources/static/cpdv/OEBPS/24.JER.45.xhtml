<h2>Jeremiah 45</h2>

<p><a id="c45_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch, the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book, from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c45_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to you, Baruch:</p>

<p><a id="c45_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> You have said: 'Woe to me, a wretched man! For the Lord has added sorrow to my sorrow. I have labored in my groaning, and I have not found rest.'</p>

<p><a id="c45_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thus says the Lord: So shall you say to him: Behold, those whom I have built up, I destroy, and those whom I have planted, I uproot, even this entire land.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And are you seeking great things for yourself? Do not choose to seek them. For behold, I will lead evil over all that is flesh, says the Lord. But I will give your life to you unto salvation, in every place, wherever you may travel."</p>
