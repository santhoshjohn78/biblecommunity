<h2>Psalms 136</h2>

<p><a id="c136_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of David: to Jeremiah. Above the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept, while we remembered Zion.</p>

<p><a id="c136_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> By the willow trees, in their midst, we hung up our instruments.</p>

<p><a id="c136_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For, in that place, those who led us into captivity questioned us about the words of the songs. And those who carried us away said: "Sing us a hymn from the songs of Zion."</p>

<p><a id="c136_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> How can we sing a song of the Lord in a foreign land?</p>

<p><a id="c136_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> If I ever forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand be forgotten.</p>

<p><a id="c136_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> May my tongue adhere to my jaws, if I do not remember you, if I do not set Jerusalem first, as the beginning of my joy.</p>

<p><a id="c136_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> O Lord, call to mind the sons of Edom, in the day of Jerusalem, who say: "Despoil it, despoil it, even to its foundation."</p>

<p><a id="c136_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> O daughter of Babylon, have pity. Blessed is he who will repay you with your payment, which you have paid to us.</p>

<p><a id="c136_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Blessed is he who will take hold of your little ones and dash them against the rock.</p>
