<h2>Psalms 141</h2>

<p><a id="c141_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The understanding of David. A prayer, when he was in the cave.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> With my voice, I cried out to the Lord. With my voice, I made supplication to the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> In his sight, I pour out my prayer, and before him, I declare my tribulation.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Though my spirit may become faint within me, even then, you have known my paths. Along this way, which I have been walking, they have hidden a snare for me.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I considered toward the right, and I looked, but there was no one who would know me. Flight has perished before me, and there is no one who has concern for my soul.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I cried out to you, O Lord. I said: You are my hope, my portion in the land of the living.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Attend to my supplication. For I have been humbled exceedingly. Free me from my persecutors, for they have been fortified against me.</p>

<p><a id="c141_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Lead my soul out of confinement in order to confess your name. The just are waiting for me, until you repay me.</p>
