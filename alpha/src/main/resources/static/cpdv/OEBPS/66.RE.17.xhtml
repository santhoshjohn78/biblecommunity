<h2>Revelation 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And one of the seven Angels, those who hold the seven bowls, approached and spoke with me, saying: "Come, I will show you the condemnation of the great harlot, who sits upon many waters.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> With her, the kings of the earth have fornicated. And those who inhabit the earth have been inebriated by the wine of her prostitution."</p>

<p><a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he carried me away in spirit to the desert. And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, filled with names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the woman was clothed all around with purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, holding a golden cup in her hand, filled with the abomination and with the filth of her fornication.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And a name was written upon her forehead: Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of the fornications and the abominations of the earth.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I saw that the woman was inebriated from the blood of the saints and from the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And I was amazed, when I had seen her, with a great wonder.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the Angel said to me: "Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has seven heads and ten horns.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The beast that you saw, was, and is not, and is soon to ascend from the abyss. And he goes forth unto destruction. And the inhabitants upon the earth (those whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world) shall be amazed upon seeing the beast who was and is not.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And this is for one who understands, who has wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains, upon which the woman sits, and they are seven kings.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet arrived. And when he arrives, he must remain for a brief time.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the beast who was, and is not, the same is also the eighth, and he is of the seven, and he goes forth unto destruction.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings; these have not yet received a kingdom, but they shall receive authority, as if they were kings, for one hour, after the beast.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> These hold to one plan, and they shall hand over their power and authority to the beast.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> These shall fight against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall conquer them. For he is the Lord of lords and the King of kings. And those who are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful."</p>

<p><a id="c17_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he said to me: "The waters that you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples and nations and languages.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the ten horns that you saw on the beast, these shall hate the woman who fornicates, and they shall make her desolate and naked, and they shall chew her flesh, and they shall burn her completely with fire.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For God has granted to their hearts that they may do to her whatever is pleasing, so that they may give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God may be completed.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the woman that you saw is the great City, which holds a kingdom above that of the kings of the earth."</p>
