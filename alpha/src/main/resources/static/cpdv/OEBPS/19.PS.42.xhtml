<h2>Psalms 42</h2>

<p><a id="c42_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of David. Judge me, O God, and discern my cause from that of a nation not holy; rescue me from a man unjust and deceitful.</p>

<p><a id="c42_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For you are God, my strength. Why have you rejected me? And why do I walk in sadness, while the adversary afflicts me?</p>

<p><a id="c42_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Send forth your light and your truth. They have guided me and led me, to your holy mountain and into your tabernacles.</p>

<p><a id="c42_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And I will enter, up to the altar of God, to God who enlivens my youthfulness. To you, O God, my God, I will confess upon a stringed instrument.</p>

<p><a id="c42_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Why are you sad, my soul? And why do you disquiet me? Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him: the salvation of my countenance and my God.</p>
