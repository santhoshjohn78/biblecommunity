<h2>Psalms 92</h2>

<p><a id="c92_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The Praise of a Canticle, of David himself. In the time before the Sabbath, when the earth was founded.</p>

<p><a id="c92_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The Lord has reigned. He has been clothed with beauty.</p>

<p><a id="c92_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The Lord has been clothed with strength, and he has girded himself. Yet he has also confirmed the world, which will not be moved.</p>

<p><a id="c92_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> My throne is prepared from of old. You are from everlasting.</p>

<p><a id="c92_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice. The floods have lifted up their waves,</p>

<p><a id="c92_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> before the noise of many waters. Wondrous are the surges of the sea; wondrous is the Lord on high.</p>

<p><a id="c92_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Your testimonies have been made exceedingly trustworthy. Sanctity befits your house, O Lord, with length of days.</p>
