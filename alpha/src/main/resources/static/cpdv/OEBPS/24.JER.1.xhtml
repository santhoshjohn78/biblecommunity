<h2>Jeremiah 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The word of the Lord, which came to him in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and which came to him in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, even until the completion of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, even until the transmigration of Jerusalem in the fifth month.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. And before you went forth from the womb, I sanctified you. And I made you a prophet to the nations."</p>

<p><a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I said: "Alas, alas, alas, Lord God! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am a boy."</p>

<p><a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the Lord said to me: "Do not choose to say, 'I am a boy.' For you shall go forth to everyone to whom I will send you. And you shall speak all that I will command you.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> You should not be afraid before their face. For I am with you, so that I may deliver you," says the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the Lord put forth his hand, and he touched my mouth. And the Lord said to me: "Behold, I have placed my words in your mouth.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Behold, today I have appointed you over nations and over kingdoms, so that you may root up, and pull down, and destroy, and scatter, and so that you may build and plant."</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" And I said, "I see a staff, keeping watch."</p>

<p><a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the Lord said to me: "You have seen well. For I will keep watch over my word, so that I may accomplish it."</p>

<p><a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see a cooking pot upon a fire, and its face is before the face of the north."</p>

<p><a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the Lord said to me: "From the north, an evil will spread over all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For behold, I will call together all the close associates of the kingdoms of the north, says the Lord. And they will arrive, and each one of them will place his throne at the entrance to the gates of Jerusalem, and over all its surrounding walls, and over all the cities of Judah.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And I will speak my judgments with them, concerning all the wickedness of those who have forsaken me, and who have offered libations to strange gods, and who have adored the work of their own hands.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Therefore, you should gird your waist, and rise up, and speak to them everything that I instruct you. You should not have dread before their face. For I will cause you to be unafraid of their countenance.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For certainly, this day, I have made you like a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and a brass wall, over all the land, to the kings of Judah, to its leaders, and to the priests, and to the people of the land.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And they will make war against you, but they will not prevail. For I am with you, says the Lord, so that I may free you."</p>
