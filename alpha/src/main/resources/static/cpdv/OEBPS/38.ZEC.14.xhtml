<h2>Zechariah 14</h2>

<p><a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Behold, the days of the Lord will arrive, and your spoils will be divided in your midst.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And I will gather all the Gentiles in battle against Jerusalem, and the city will be captured, and the houses will be ravaged, and the women will be violated. And the central part of the city will go forth into captivity, and the remainder of the people will not be taken away from the city.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Then the Lord will go forth, and he will fight against those Gentiles, just as when he fought in the day of conflict.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And his feet will stand firm, in that day, upon the Mount of Olives, which is opposite Jerusalem towards the East. And the mount of Olives will be divided down its center part, towards the East and towards the West, with a very great rupture, and the center of the mountain will be separated towards the North, and its center towards the Meridian.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And you will flee to the valley of those mountains, because the valley of the mountains will be joined all the way to the next. And you will flee, just as you fled from the face of the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. And the Lord my God will arrive, and all the saints with him.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And this shall be in that day: there will not be light, only cold and frost.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And there will be one day, which is known to the Lord, not day and not night. And in the time of the evening, there will be light.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And this shall be in that day: the living waters will go out from Jerusalem, half of them towards the East sea, and half of them towards the furthest sea. They will be in summer and in winter.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the Lord will be King over all the earth. In that day, there will be one Lord, and his name will be one.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And all the land will return even to the desert, from the hill of Rimmon to the South of Jerusalem. And she will be exalted, and she will dwell in her own place, from the gate of Benjamin even to the place of the former gate, and even to the gate of the corners, and from the tower of Hananel even to the pressing room of the king.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And they will dwell in it, and there will be no further anathema, but Jerusalem shall sit securely.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And this will be the plague by which the Lord will strike all the Gentiles that have fought against Jerusalem. The flesh of each one will waste away while they are standing on their feet, and their eyes will be consumed in their sockets, and their tongue will be consumed in their mouth.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> In that day, there will be a great tumult from the Lord among them. And a man will take the hand of his neighbor, and his hand will be clasped upon the hand of his neighbor.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And even Judah will fight against Jerusalem. And the riches of all the Gentiles will be gathered together around them: gold, and silver, and more than enough garments.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And, like the ruin of the horse, and the mule, and the camel, and the donkey, and all the beasts of burden, which will have been in those encampments, so will be this ruination.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And all those who will be the remnant of all the Gentiles that came against Jerusalem, will go up, from year to year, to adore the King, the Lord of hosts, and to celebrate the feast of tabernacles.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And this shall be: whoever will not go up, from the families of the earth to Jerusalem, so as to adore the King, the Lord of hosts, there will be no showers upon them.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> But if even the family of Egypt will go not up, nor approach, neither will it be upon them, but there will be ruin, by which the Lord will strike all the Gentiles, who will not go up to celebrate the feast of tabernacles.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> This will be the sin of Egypt, and this will be the sin of all the Gentiles, who will not go up to celebrate the feast of tabernacles.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> In that day, that which is on the bridle of the horse will be holy to the Lord. And even the cooking pots in the house of the Lord will be like holy vessels before the altar.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And every cooking pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be sanctified to the Lord of hosts. And all those who make sacrifices will come and take from them, and will cook with them. And the merchant will no longer be in the house of the Lord of hosts, in that day.</p>
