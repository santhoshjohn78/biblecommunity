<h2>Psalms 98</h2>

<p><a id="c98_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of David himself. The Lord has reigned: let the peoples be angry. He sits upon the cherubim: let the earth be moved.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The Lord is great in Zion, and he is high above all peoples.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> May they confess to your great name, for it is terrible and holy.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the honor of the king loves judgment. You have prepared guidance. You have accomplished judgment and justice in Jacob.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Exalt the Lord our God, and adore the footstool of his feet, for it is holy.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Moses and Aaron are among his priests, and Samuel is among those who call upon his name. They called upon the Lord, and he heeded them.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud. They kept his testimonies and the precept that he gave them.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> You heeded them, O Lord our God. You were a forgiving God to them, though taking vengeance on all their inventions.</p>

<p><a id="c98_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Exalt the Lord our God, and adore on his holy mountain. For the Lord our God is holy.</p>
