<h2>Psalms 114</h2>

<p><a id="c114_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Alleluia. I have loved: therefore, the Lord will heed the voice of my prayer.</p>

<p><a id="c114_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For he has inclined his ear to me. And in my days, I will call upon him.</p>

<p><a id="c114_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The sorrows of death have surrounded me, and the perils of Hell have found me. I have found tribulation and sorrow.</p>

<p><a id="c114_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And so, I called upon the name of the Lord. O Lord, free my soul.</p>

<p><a id="c114_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Merciful is the Lord, and just. And our God is compassionate.</p>

<p><a id="c114_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The Lord is the keeper of little ones. I was humbled, and he freed me.</p>

<p><a id="c114_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Turn again, my soul, to your rest. For the Lord has done good to you.</p>

<p><a id="c114_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For he has rescued my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from slipping.</p>

<p><a id="c114_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I will please the Lord in the land of the living.</p>
