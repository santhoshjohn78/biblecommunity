<h2>Psalms 14</h2>

<p><a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Psalm of David. O Lord, who will dwell in your tabernacle? Or who will rest on your holy mountain?</p>

<p><a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> He who walks without blemish and who works justice.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He who speaks the truth in his heart, who has not acted deceitfully with his tongue, and has not done evil to his neighbor, and has not taken up a reproach against his neighbors.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> In his sight, the malicious one has been reduced to nothing, but he glorifies those who fear the Lord. He who swears to his neighbor and does not deceive.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He who has not given his money in usury, nor accepted bribes against the innocent. He who does these things will be undisturbed for eternity.</p>
