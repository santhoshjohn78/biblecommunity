<h2>1 Chronicles 22</h2>

<p><a id="c22_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And David said, "This is the house of God, and this is the altar for the holocaust of Israel."</p>

<p><a id="c22_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he instructed them to gather all the new converts from the land of Israel. And from these he appointed stoneworkers, to hew stones and to polish them, so that he might build the house of God.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Also, David prepared very much iron to use for the nails of the gates, and for the seams and joints, as well as an immeasurable weight of brass.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Also, the cedar trees, which the Sidonians and Tyrians had transported to David, were not able to be counted.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And David said: "My son Solomon is a young and tender boy. But the house that I desire to be built to the Lord ought to be so great that it is renowned in every region. Therefore, I will prepare what will be necessary for him." And for this reason, before his death, he prepared all the expenses.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he called for Solomon, his son. And he instructed him to build a house to the Lord, the God of Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And David said to Solomon: "My son, it was my will that I build a house to the name of the Lord my God.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But the word of the Lord came to me, saying: 'You have shed much blood, and you have battled in many wars. You are not able to build a house to my name, so great was the shedding of blood before me.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The son who shall be born to you will be a very quiet man. For I will cause him to have rest from all his enemies on every side. And for this reason, he shall be called Peaceful. And I will grant peace and tranquility to Israel during all his days.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> He shall build a house to my name. And he shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel unto eternity.'</p>

<p><a id="c22_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Now then, my son, may the Lord be with you, and may you prosper and build a house to the Lord your God, just as he has spoken concerning you.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Also, may the Lord give you prudence and understanding, so that you may be able to rule Israel and to guard the law of the Lord your God.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For then you will be able to advance, if you keep the commandments and judgments that the Lord instructed Moses to teach to Israel. Be strengthened and act manfully. You should not fear, and you should not dread.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Behold, in my poverty I have prepared the expenses for the house of the Lord: one hundred thousand talents of gold, and one million of talents of silver. Yet truly, there is no measuring the brass and the iron. For their magnitude is beyond numbering. And I have prepared the timber and the stones for the entire project.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Also, you have very many artisans: stoneworkers, and builders of walls, and craftsmen of wood, and those most prudent in doing the work of every art,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> with gold and silver, and with brass and iron, of which there is no number. Therefore, rise up and act. And the Lord will be with you."</p>

<p><a id="c22_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Also, David instructed all the leaders of Israel, so that they would assist his son Solomon,</p>

<p><a id="c22_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> saying: "You discern that the Lord your God is with you, and that he has given you rest on all sides, and that he has delivered all your enemies into your hands, and that the land has been subdued before the Lord and before his people.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Therefore, offer your hearts and your souls, so that you seek the Lord your God. And rise up and build a sanctuary to the Lord God, so that the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the vessels consecrated to the Lord, may be brought into the house that is built to the name of the Lord."</p>
