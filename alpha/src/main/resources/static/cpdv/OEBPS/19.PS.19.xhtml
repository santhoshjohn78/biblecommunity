<h2>Psalms 19</h2>

<p><a id="c19_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unto the end. A Psalm of David.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> May the Lord hear you in the day of tribulation. May the name of the God of Jacob protect you.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> May he send you help from the sanctuary and watch over you from Zion.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> May he be mindful of all your sacrifices, and may your burnt-offerings be fat.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> May he grant to you according to your heart, and confirm all your counsels.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> We will rejoice in your salvation, and in the name of our God, we will be magnified.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> May the Lord fulfill all your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved his Christ. He will hear him from his holy heaven. The salvation of his right hand is in his power.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will call upon the name of the Lord our God.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> They have been bound, and they have fallen. But we have risen up, and we have been set upright.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> O Lord, save the king, and hear us on the day that we will call upon you.</p>
