<h2>Psalms 94</h2>

<p><a id="c94_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The Praise of a Canticle, of David himself. Come, let us exult in the Lord. Let us shout joyfully to God, our Savior.</p>

<p><a id="c94_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let us anticipate his presence with confession, and let us sing joyfully to him with psalms.</p>

<p><a id="c94_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For the Lord is a great God and a great King over all gods.</p>

<p><a id="c94_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For in his hand are all the limits of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are his.</p>

<p><a id="c94_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For the sea is his, and he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.</p>

<p><a id="c94_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Come, let us adore and fall prostrate, and let us weep before the Lord who made us.</p>

<p><a id="c94_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For he is the Lord our God, and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand.</p>

<p><a id="c94_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts:</p>

<p><a id="c94_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> as in the provocation, according to the day of temptation in the wilderness, where your fathers tempted me; they tested me, though they had seen my works.</p>

<p><a id="c94_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For forty years, I was offended by that generation, and I said: These have always strayed in heart.</p>

<p><a id="c94_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And these have not known my ways. So I swore in my wrath: They shall not enter into my rest.</p>
