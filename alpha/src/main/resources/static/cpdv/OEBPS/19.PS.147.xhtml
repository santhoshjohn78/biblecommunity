<h2>Psalms 147</h2>

<p><a id="c147_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Alleluia. Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem. Praise your God, O Zion.</p>

<p><a id="c147_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For he has reinforced the bars of your gates. He has blessed your sons within you.</p>

<p><a id="c147_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He has stationed peace at your borders, and he has satisfied you with the fat of the grain.</p>

<p><a id="c147_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He sends forth his eloquence to the earth. His word runs swiftly.</p>

<p><a id="c147_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He provides snow like wool. He strews clouds like ashes.</p>

<p><a id="c147_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He sends his ice crystals like morsels. Who can stand firm before the face of his cold?</p>

<p><a id="c147_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He will send forth his word, and it will melt them. His Spirit will breathe out, and the waters will flow.</p>

<p><a id="c147_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He announces his word to Jacob, his justices and his judgments to Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c147_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He has not done so much for every nation, and he has not made his judgments manifest to them. Alleluia.</p>
