<p><a id="c66_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> May God have mercy on us and bless us. May he shine his countenance upon us, and may he have mercy on us.</p>

<p><a id="c66_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> So may we know your way upon the earth, your salvation among all nations.</p>

<p><a id="c66_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Let the peoples confess to you, O God. Let all the peoples confess to you.</p>

<p><a id="c66_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> May the nations rejoice and exult. For you judge the peoples with equity, and you direct the nations on earth.</p>

<p><a id="c66_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let the peoples confess to you, O God. Let all the peoples confess to you.</p>

<p><a id="c66_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The earth has provided her fruit. May God, our God, bless us.</p>

<p><a id="c66_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> May God bless us, and may all the ends of the earth fear him.</p>
