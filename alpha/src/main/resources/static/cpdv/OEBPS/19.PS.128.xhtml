<h2>Psalms 128</h2>

<p><a id="c128_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Canticle in steps. They have often fought against me from my youth, let Israel now say:</p>

<p><a id="c128_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> they have often fought against me from my youth, yet they could not prevail over me.</p>

<p><a id="c128_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The sinners have made fabrications behind my back. They have prolonged their iniquity.</p>

<p><a id="c128_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The just Lord will cut the necks of sinners.</p>

<p><a id="c128_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Let all those who hate Zion be confounded and turned backwards.</p>

<p><a id="c128_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let them be like grass on the rooftops, which withers before it can be pulled up:</p>

<p><a id="c128_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> with it, he who reaps does not fill his hand and he who gathers sheaves does not fill his bosom.</p>

<p><a id="c128_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And those who were passing by have not said to them: "The blessing of the Lord be upon you. We have blessed you in the name of the Lord."</p>
