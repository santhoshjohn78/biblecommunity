<h2>Psalms 127</h2>

<p><a id="c127_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A Canticle in steps. Blessed are all those who fear the Lord, who walk in his ways.</p>

<p><a id="c127_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For you will eat by the labors of your hands. Blessed are you, and it will be well with you.</p>

<p><a id="c127_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Your wife is like an abundant vine on the sides of your house. Your sons are like young olive trees surrounding your table.</p>

<p><a id="c127_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Behold, so will the man be blessed who fears the Lord.</p>

<p><a id="c127_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> May the Lord bless you from Zion, and may you see the good things of Jerusalem, all the days of your life.</p>

<p><a id="c127_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And may you see the sons of your sons. Peace be upon Israel.</p>
