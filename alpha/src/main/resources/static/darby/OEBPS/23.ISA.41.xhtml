<h2>Isaiah 41</h2>

<p><a id="c41_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Keep silence before me, islands; and let the peoples renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us draw near together to judgment. <a id="c41_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Who raised up from the east him whom righteousness calleth to its foot? He gave the nations before him, and caused him to have dominion over kings; he gave them as dust to his sword, as driven stubble to his bow. <a id="c41_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He pursued them, he passed on in safety, by a way he had never come with his feet. <a id="c41_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I, Jehovah, the first; and with the last, I am HE. <a id="c41_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth trembled: they drew near, and came. <a id="c41_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> They helped every one his neighbour, and each said to his brother, Take courage. <a id="c41_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the artizan encouraged the founder, he that smootheth with the hammer him that smiteth on the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good; and he fasteneth it with nails, that it be not moved. <a id="c41_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But thou, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham, my friend <a id="c41_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> --thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called from the extremities thereof, and to whom I said, Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee and not rejected thee,</p>

<p><a id="c41_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> --Fear not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> I will strengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. <a id="c41_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Lo, all that are incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded; they that strive with thee shall be as nothing, and shall perish. <a id="c41_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them--them that contend with thee; they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought. <a id="c41_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For I, Jehovah, thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee. <a id="c41_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Fear not, thou worm Jacob, ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith Jehovah, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. <a id="c41_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Behold, I have made of thee a new sharp threshing instrument having double teeth: thou shalt thresh and beat small the mountains, and shalt make the hills as chaff; <a id="c41_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them; and thou shalt rejoice in Jehovah, thou shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel. <a id="c41_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The afflicted and the needy seek water, and there is none; their tongue faileth for thirst: I, Jehovah, will answer them, I, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> of Israel, will not forsake them. <a id="c41_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness into a pool of water, and the dry land into water-springs. <a id="c41_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> I will give in the wilderness the cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oleaster; I will set in the desert the cypress, pine, and box-tree together; <a id="c41_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of Jehovah hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.</p>

<p><a id="c41_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Produce your cause, saith Jehovah; bring forward your arguments, saith the King of Jacob. <a id="c41_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Let them bring them forward, and declare to us what shall happen: shew the former things, what they are, that we may give attention to them, and know the end of them; --or let us hear things to come: <a id="c41_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> declare the things that are to happen hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods; yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be astonished, and behold it together. <a id="c41_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Behold, ye are less than nothing, and your work is of nought; an abomination is he that chooseth you. ... <a id="c41_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come, --from the rising of the sun, he who will call upon my name; and he shall come upon princes as on mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay. <a id="c41_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Who hath declared it from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, It is right? Indeed, there is none that declareth; no, none that sheweth; no, none that heareth your words. <a id="c41_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The first, I said to Zion, Behold, behold them! and to Jerusalem, I will give one that bringeth glad tidings. <a id="c41_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, --and there was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word. <a id="c41_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Behold, they are all vanity, their works are nought, their molten images are wind and emptiness.</p>
