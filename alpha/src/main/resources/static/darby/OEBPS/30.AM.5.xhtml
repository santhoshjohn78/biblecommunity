<h2>Amos 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Hear this word, a lamentation, which I take up against you, O house of Israel. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more arise: she is cast down upon her land; there is none to raise her up. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, for the house of Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For thus saith Jehovah unto the house of Israel: Seek ye me, and ye shall live. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And seek not Bethel, neither go to Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba; for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth, <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> seek him that made the Pleiades and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: Jehovah is his name. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He causeth destruction to break forth suddenly upon the strong, and bringeth destruction upon the fortress. <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> They hate him that reproveth in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Forasmuch, therefore, as ye trample upon the poor, and take from him presents of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, and ye shall not drink the wine of them. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For I know how manifold are your transgressions and your sins mighty: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the right of the needy in the gate. <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in this time; for it is an evil time. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live; and so Jehovah, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of hosts, shall be with you, as ye say. <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Hate evil, and love good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that Jehovah, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> of hosts, the Lord: Wailing shall be in all broadways; and they shall say in all the streets, Alas! alas! And they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing. <a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And in all vineyards shall be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah. <a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! To what end is the day of Jehovah for you? It shall be darkness and not light: <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> as if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</p>

<p><a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will not smell a sweet odour in your solemn assemblies. <a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For if ye offer up unto me burnt-offerings and your oblations, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fatted beasts. <a id="c5_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Take away from me the noise of thy songs, and I will not hear the melody of thy lutes; <a id="c5_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> but let judgment roll down as waters, and righteousness as an ever-flowing stream. <a id="c5_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and oblations in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? <a id="c5_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of your Moloch, and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye had made to yourselves; <a id="c5_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith Jehovah, whose name is the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> of hosts.</p>
