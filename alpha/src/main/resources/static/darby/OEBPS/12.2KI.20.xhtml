<h2>2 Kings 20</h2>

<p><a id="c20_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In those days Hezekiah was sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live. <a id="c20_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Jehovah saying, <a id="c20_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Ah! Jehovah, remember, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done what is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept much. <a id="c20_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And it came to pass before Isaiah had gone out into the middle city that the word of Jehovah came to him saying, <a id="c20_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Return, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up to the house of Jehovah; <a id="c20_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and I will add to thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. <a id="c20_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered. <a id="c20_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What shall be the sign that Jehovah will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of Jehovah the third day? <a id="c20_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Isaiah said, This shall be the sign to thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees? <a id="c20_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Hezekiah said, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: no, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees. <a id="c20_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Isaiah the prophet cried to Jehovah, and he brought the shadow back on the degrees by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> At that time Berodach-Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent a letter and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. <a id="c20_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Hezekiah hearkened to them, and shewed them all his treasure-house, the silver and the gold, and the spices and the fine oil, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found among his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not shew them. <a id="c20_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Then came the prophet Isaiah to king Hezekiah and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to thee? And Hezekiah said, They came from a far country, from Babylon. <a id="c20_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah said, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewn them. <a id="c20_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah: <a id="c20_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Behold, days come that all that is in thy house, and what thy fathers have laid up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah. <a id="c20_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be chamberlains in the palace of the king of Babylon. <a id="c20_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not so? if only there shall be peace and truth in my days! <a id="c20_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool and the aqueduct, and brought the water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <a id="c20_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</p>
