<h2>Psalms 130</h2>

<p><a id="c130_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Out of the depths do I call upon thee, Jehovah. <a id="c130_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Lord, hear my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication. <a id="c130_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If thou, Jah, shouldest mark iniquities, Lord, who shall stand? <a id="c130_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</p>

<p><a id="c130_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I wait for Jehovah; my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. <a id="c130_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> My soul waiteth for the Lord more than the watchers wait for the morning, more than the watchers for the morning. <a id="c130_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Let Israel hope in Jehovah, because with Jehovah there is loving-kindness, and with him is plenteous redemption; <a id="c130_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.</p>
