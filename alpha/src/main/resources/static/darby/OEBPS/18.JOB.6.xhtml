<h2>Job 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Job answered and said, <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances! <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; therefore my words are vehement. <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, their poison drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of +God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> are arrayed against me. <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Doth the wild ass bray by the grass? loweth an ox over his fodder? <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Shall that which is insipid be eaten without salt? Is there any taste in the white of an egg? <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> What my soul refuseth to touch, that is as my loathsome food.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Oh that I might have my request, and that +God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> would grant my desire! <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And that it would please +God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off! <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Then should I yet have comfort; and in the pain which spareth not I would rejoice that I have not denied the words of the Holy One. <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should have patience? <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Is my strength the strength of stones? is my flesh of brass? <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Is it not that there is no help in me, and soundness is driven away from me?</p>

<p><a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For him that is fainting kindness is meet from his friend; or he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. <a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a stream, as the channel of streams which pass away, <a id="c6_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Which are turbid by reason of the ice, in which the snow hideth itself: <a id="c6_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> At the time they diminish, they are dried up; when heat affecteth them, they vanish from their place: <a id="c6_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> They wind about in the paths of their course, they go off into the waste and perish. <a id="c6_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The caravans of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba counted on them: <a id="c6_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> They are ashamed at their hope; they come thither, and are confounded. <a id="c6_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> So now ye are nothing; ye see a terrible object and are afraid.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Did I say, Bring unto me, and make me a present from your substance? <a id="c6_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Or, rescue me from the hand of the oppressor, and redeem me from the hand of the violent? <a id="c6_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Teach me, and I will hold my tongue; and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. <a id="c6_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> How forcible are right words! but what doth your upbraiding reprove? <a id="c6_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Do ye imagine to reprove words? The speeches of one that is desperate are indeed for the wind. <a id="c6_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and dig a pit for your friend. <a id="c6_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Now therefore if ye will, look upon me; and it shall be to your face if I lie. <a id="c6_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Return, I pray you, let there be no wrong; yea, return again, my righteousness shall be in it. <a id="c6_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Is there wrong in my tongue? cannot my taste discern mischievous things?</p>
