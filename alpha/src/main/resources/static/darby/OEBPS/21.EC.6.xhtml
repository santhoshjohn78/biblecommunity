<h2>Ecclesiastes 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it is frequent among men: <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> one to whom God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> giveth riches, wealth, and honour, and he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and a sore evil. <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If a man beget a hundred sons, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, but his soul be not filled with good, and also he have no burial, I say an untimely birth is better than he. <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For it cometh in vanity, and departeth in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness; <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> moreover it hath not seen nor known the sun: this hath rest rather than the other. <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Yea, though he live twice a thousand years, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?</p>

<p><a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled. <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For what advantage hath the wise above the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living? <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Better is the seeing of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this also is vanity and pursuit of the wind. <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> That which is hath already been named; and what man is, is known, and that he cannot contend with him that is mightier than he.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For there are many things that increase vanity: what is man advantaged? <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For who knoweth what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell man what shall be after him under the sun?</p>
