<h2>Psalms 55</h2>

<p><a id="c55_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Give ear to my prayer, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> and hide not thyself from my supplication. <a id="c55_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Attend unto me, and answer me: I wander about in my plaint, and I moan aloud, <a id="c55_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Because of the voice of the enemy; because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in anger they persecute me. <a id="c55_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> My heart is writhing within me, and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. <a id="c55_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Fear and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. <a id="c55_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away, and be at rest; <a id="c55_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Behold, I would flee afar off, I would lodge in the wilderness; Selah; <a id="c55_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I would hasten my escape from the stormy wind, from the tempest.</p>

<p><a id="c55_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Swallow them up, Lord; divide their tongue: for I have seen violence and strife in the city. <a id="c55_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof; and iniquity and mischief are in the midst of it. <a id="c55_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Perversities are in the midst thereof; and oppression and deceit depart not from its streets. <a id="c55_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For it is not an enemy that hath reproached me--then could I have borne it; neither is it he that hateth me that hath magnified himself against me--then would I have hidden myself from him; <a id="c55_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But it was thou, a man mine equal, mine intimate, my familiar friend. ... <a id="c55_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> We who held sweet intercourse together. To the house of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> we walked amid the throng. <a id="c55_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Let death seize upon them, let them go down alive into Sheol. For wickedness is in their dwellings, in their midst.</p>

<p><a id="c55_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> As for me, unto God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> will I call; and Jehovah will save me. <a id="c55_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray and moan aloud; and he will hear my voice. <a id="c55_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> He hath redeemed my soul in peace from the battle against me: for there were many about me. <a id="c55_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> will hear, and afflict them: he that is seated of old, (Selah) ...because there is no change in them, and they fear not God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a>  <a id="c55_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> He hath put forth his hands against such as are at peace with him; he hath profaned his covenant. <a id="c55_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Smooth were the milky words of his mouth, but his heart was war; his words were softer than oil, yet are they drawn swords. <a id="c55_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Cast thy burden upon Jehovah, and he will sustain thee: he will never suffer the righteous to be moved. <a id="c55_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And thou, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days. But as for me, I will confide in thee.</p>
