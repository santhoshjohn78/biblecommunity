<h2>Psalms 95</h2>

<p><a id="c95_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Come, let us sing aloud to Jehovah, let us shout for joy to the rock of our salvation; <a id="c95_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let us come before his face with thanksgiving; let us shout aloud unto him with psalms. <a id="c95_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For Jehovah is a great Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> and a great king above all gods. <a id="c95_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> In his hand are the deep places of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also: <a id="c95_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The sea is his, and he made it, and his hands formed the dry land. <a id="c95_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker.</p>

<p><a id="c95_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For he is our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. To-day if ye hear his voice, <a id="c95_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah, in the wilderness; <a id="c95_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. <a id="c95_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Forty years was I grieved with the generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways; <a id="c95_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> So that I swore in mine anger, that they should not enter into my rest.</p>
