<h2>Exodus 31</h2>

<p><a id="c31_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, <a id="c31_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, <a id="c31_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and have filled him with the spirit of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in every work, <a id="c31_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> to devise artistic work--to work in gold, and in silver, and in copper, <a id="c31_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and in cutting of stones, for setting, and for carving of timber--to work in all manner of work. <a id="c31_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of every one that is wise-hearted have I given wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee-- <a id="c31_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the utensils of the tent, <a id="c31_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and the table and its utensils, and the pure lamp-stand and all its utensils, and the altar of incense; <a id="c31_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and the altar of burnt-offering and all its utensils, and the laver and its stand; <a id="c31_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and the garments of service, both the holy garments of Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to serve as priests; <a id="c31_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and the anointing oil, and the incense of fragrant drugs for the sanctuary: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.</p>

<p><a id="c31_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, <a id="c31_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And thou, speak thou unto the children of Israel, saying, Surely my sabbaths shall ye keep; for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that ye may know that it is I, Jehovah, who do hallow you. <a id="c31_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Keep the sabbath, therefore; for it is holy unto you; every one that profaneth it shall certainly be put to death: yea, whoever doeth work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his peoples. <a id="c31_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, holy to Jehovah: whoever doeth work on the sabbath day shall certainly be put to death. <a id="c31_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations-- it is an everlasting covenant. <a id="c31_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> It shall be a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever; for in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. <a id="c31_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And he gave to Moses, when he had ended speaking with him on mount Sinai, the two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> .</p>
