<h2>1 Peter 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, that, even if any are disobedient to the word, they may be gained without the word by the conversation of the wives, <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> having witnessed your pure conversation carried out in fear; <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> whose adorning let it not be that outward one of tressing of hair, and wearing gold, or putting on apparel; <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> but the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For thus also the holy women who have hoped in God heretofore adorned themselves, being subject to their own husbands; <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose children ye have become, doing good, and not fearing with any kind of consternation. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Ye husbands likewise, dwell with them according to knowledge, as with a weaker, even the female, vessel, giving them honour, as also fellow-heirs of thegrace of life, that your prayers be not hindered.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Finally, be all of one mind, sympathising, full of brotherly love, tender hearted, humble minded; <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing; but on the contrary, blessing others, because ye have been called to this, that ye should inherit blessing. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For he that will love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips that they speak no guile. <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And let him avoid evil, and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it; <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> because the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears towards their supplications; but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And who shall injure you if ye have become imitators of that which is good? <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But if also ye should suffer for righteousness' sake, blessed are ye; but be not afraid of their fear, neither be troubled; <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> but sanctify the Lord the Christ in your hearts, and be always prepared to give an answer to every one that asks you to give an account of the hope that is in you, but with meekness and fear;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> having a good conscience, that as to that in which they speak against you as evildoers, they may be ashamed who calumniate your good conversation in Christ. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For it is better, if the will of God should will it, to suffer as well-doers than as evildoers;</p>

<p><a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> for Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in flesh, but made alive in the Spirit, <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> in which also going he preached to the spirits which are in prison, <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> heretofore disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was preparing, into which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:</p>

<p><a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> which figure also now saves you, even baptism, not a putting away of the filth of flesh, but the demand as before God of a good conscience, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, <a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> who is at the right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him.</p>
