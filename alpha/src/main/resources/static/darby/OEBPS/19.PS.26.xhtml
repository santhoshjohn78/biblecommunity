<h2>Psalms 26</h2>

<p><a id="c26_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity, and I have confided in Jehovah: I shall not slip. <a id="c26_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Prove me, Jehovah, and test me; try my reins and my heart: <a id="c26_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For thy loving-kindness is before mine eyes, and I have walked in thy truth. <a id="c26_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I have not sat with vain persons, neither have I gone in with dissemblers; <a id="c26_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I have hated the congregation of evil-doers, and I have not sat with the wicked.</p>

<p><a id="c26_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I will wash my hands in innocency, and will encompass thine altar, O Jehovah, <a id="c26_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> That I may cause the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, and declare all thy marvellous works. <a id="c26_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Jehovah, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth. <a id="c26_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood; <a id="c26_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> In whose hands are evil devices, and their right hand is full of bribes. <a id="c26_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity. Redeem me, and be gracious unto me. <a id="c26_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> My foot standeth in an even place; in the congregations will I bless Jehovah.</p>
