<h2>Genesis 48</h2>

<p><a id="c48_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick. And he took with him his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim. <a id="c48_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And one told Jacob and said, Behold, thy son Joseph is coming to thee. And Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. <a id="c48_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Jacob said to Joseph, The Almighty Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, <a id="c48_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and he said to me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. <a id="c48_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And now thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came to thee into Egypt, shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon. <a id="c48_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And thy family which thou hast begotten after them shall be thine: they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. <a id="c48_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was yet a certain distance to come to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath, that is, Bethlehem.</p>

<p><a id="c48_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? <a id="c48_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> has given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, to me, that I may bless them. <a id="c48_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But the eyes of Israel were heavy from age: he could not see. And he brought them nearer to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. <a id="c48_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face; and behold, God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> has let me see also thy seed. <a id="c48_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Joseph brought them out from his knees, and bowed down with his face to the earth. <a id="c48_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him. <a id="c48_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head--now he was the younger--and his left hand on Manasseh's head; guiding his hands intelligently, for Manasseh was the firstborn. <a id="c48_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> that shepherded me all my life long to this day, <a id="c48_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> the Angel that redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the land! <a id="c48_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it was evil in his eyes; and he took hold of his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. <a id="c48_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn: put thy right hand on his head. <a id="c48_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know: he also will become a people, and he also will be great; but truly his younger brother will be greater than he; and his seed will become the fulness of nations. <a id="c48_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> make thee as Ephraim and Manasseh! And he set Ephraim before Manasseh. <a id="c48_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; and God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers. <a id="c48_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And I have given to thee one tract of land above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</p>
