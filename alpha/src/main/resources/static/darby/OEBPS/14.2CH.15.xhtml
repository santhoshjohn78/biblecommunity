<h2>2 Chronicles 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the Spirit of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> came upon Azariah the son of Oded. <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Jehovah is with you while ye are with him; and if ye seek him he will be found of you, but if ye forsake him he will forsake you. <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Now for a long while Israel was without the true God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> and without a teaching priest, and without law; <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> but in their trouble they turned to Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> of Israel, and sought him, and he was found of them. <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in, but great disturbances were amongst all the inhabitants of the countries. <a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And nation was broken against nation, and city against city; for God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> disturbed them with all manner of distress. <a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But as for you, be firm and let not your hands be weak; for there is a reward for your deeds.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities that he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah. <a id="c15_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he assembled all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon; for they fell away to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Jehovah his God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> was with him. <a id="c15_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And they assembled themselves at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. <a id="c15_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And they sacrificed to Jehovah in that day, of the spoil that they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep. <a id="c15_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And they entered into a covenant to seek Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> of their fathers, with all their heart, and with all their soul, <a id="c15_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and that whoever would not seek Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. <a id="c15_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And they swore to Jehovah with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets. <a id="c15_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they took the oath with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them. And Jehovah gave them rest round about. <a id="c15_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And also Maachah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol for the Asherah; and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burned it in the valley Kidron. <a id="c15_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> But the high places were not removed from Israel; only, Asa's heart was perfect all his days. <a id="c15_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And he brought into the house of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels. <a id="c15_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.</p>
