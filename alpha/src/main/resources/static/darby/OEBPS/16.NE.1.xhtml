<h2>Nehemiah 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the fortress, <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And they said to me, Those who remain, that are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction and reproach; and the wall of Jerusalem is in ruins, and its gates are burned with fire. <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat and wept, and mourned for days, and fasted, and prayed before the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of the heavens,</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and said, I beseech thee, Jehovah, God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of the heavens, the great and terrible Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and keep his commandments. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, confessing the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned. <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> We have acted very perversely against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances that thou commandedst thy servant Moses. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the peoples; <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> but if ye return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there. <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And they are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand. <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was the king's cupbearer.</p>
