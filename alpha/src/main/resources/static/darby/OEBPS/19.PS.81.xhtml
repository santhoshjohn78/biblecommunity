<h2>Psalms 81</h2>

<p><a id="c81_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Sing ye joyously unto God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> our strength, shout aloud unto the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of Jacob; <a id="c81_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Raise a song, and sound the tambour, the pleasant harp with the lute. <a id="c81_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the set time, on our feast day: <a id="c81_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For this is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> of Jacob; <a id="c81_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He ordained it in Joseph for a testimony, when he went forth over the land of Egypt, where I heard a language that I knew not. <a id="c81_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were freed from the basket. <a id="c81_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c81_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Hear, my people, and I will testify unto thee; O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me! <a id="c81_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> There shall no strange god<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> be in thee, neither shalt thou worship any foreign god<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a>  <a id="c81_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I am Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> that brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. <a id="c81_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But my people hearkened not to my voice, and Israel would none of me. <a id="c81_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> So I gave them up unto their own hearts' stubbornness: they walked after their own counsels. <a id="c81_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, that Israel had walked in my ways! <a id="c81_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I would soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries. <a id="c81_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The haters of Jehovah would have come cringing unto him; but their time would have been for ever. <a id="c81_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he would have fed them with the finest of wheat; yea, with honey out of the rock would I have satisfied thee.</p>
