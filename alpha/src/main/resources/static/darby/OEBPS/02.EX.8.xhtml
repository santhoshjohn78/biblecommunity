<h2>Exodus 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah said to Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah: Let my people go, that they may serve me. <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs. <a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the river shall swarm with frogs, and they shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedroom, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy bondmen, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs. <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the frogs shall come up both upon thee and upon thy people, and upon all thy bondmen. <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Jehovah said to Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy hand with thy staff over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt. <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the scribes did so with their sorceries, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt. <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat Jehovah, that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Jehovah. <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me, for what time shall I intreat for thee, and for thy bondmen, and for thy people, to cut off the frogs from thee and from thy houses; so that they shall remain in the river only? <a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he said, For to-morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like Jehovah our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a>  <a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy bondmen, and from thy people: they shall remain in the river only. <a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried to Jehovah because of the frogs that he had brought against Pharaoh. <a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields. <a id="c8_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And they gathered them in heaps; and the land stank. <a id="c8_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Pharaoh saw that there was respite; and he hardened his heart, and hearkened not to them, as Jehovah had said.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Jehovah said to Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy staff, and smite the dust of the earth, and it shall become gnats throughout the land of Egypt. <a id="c8_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and smote the dust of the earth, and there arose gnats on man and on beast: all the dust of the land became gnats throughout the land of Egypt. <a id="c8_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the scribes did so with their sorceries, to bring forth gnats; but they could not. And the gnats were on man and on beast. <a id="c8_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Then the scribes said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> But Pharaoh's heart was stubborn, and he hearkened not to them, as Jehovah had said.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh--behold, he will go out to the water--and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me. <a id="c8_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For, if thou do not let my people go, behold, I will send dog-flies upon thee, and upon thy bondmen, and upon thy people, and into thy houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of dog-flies, and also the ground on which they are. <a id="c8_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And I will distinguish in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no dog-flies shall be there; that thou mayest know that I Jehovah am in the midst of the land. <a id="c8_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And I will put a separation between my people and thy people; to-morrow shall this sign be. <a id="c8_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Jehovah did so; and there came dog-flies in a multitude into the house of Pharaoh, and into the houses of his bondmen; and throughout the land of Egypt, the land was corrupted by the dog-flies. <a id="c8_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Go, sacrifice to your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> in the land. <a id="c8_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Moses said, It is not proper to do so; for we should sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> lo, if we sacrificed the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, would they not stone us? <a id="c8_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> as he shall command us. <a id="c8_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> in the wilderness; only, go not very far away: intreat for me! <a id="c8_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and will intreat Jehovah; and the dog-flies will depart from Pharaoh, from his bondmen, and from his people, to-morrow; only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah. <a id="c8_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated Jehovah. <a id="c8_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the dog-flies from Pharaoh, from his bondmen, and from his people; there remained not one. <a id="c8_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and would not let the people go.</p>
