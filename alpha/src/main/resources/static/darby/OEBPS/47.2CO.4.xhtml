<h2>2 Corinthians 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Therefore, having this ministry, as we have had mercy shewn us, we faint not. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> But we have rejected the hidden things of shame, not walking in deceit, nor falsifying the word of God, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But if also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost; <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> in whom the god of this world has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine forth for them. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus Lord, and ourselves your bondmen for Jesus' sake. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Because it is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us:</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> every way afflicted, but not straitened; seeing no apparent issue, but our way not entirely shut up; <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> persecuted, but not abandoned; cast down, but not destroyed; <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body; <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> for we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh; <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> so that death works in us, but life in you. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, I have believed, therefore have I spoken; we also believe, therefore also we speak; <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> knowing that he who has raised the Lord Jesus shall raise us also with Jesus, and shall present us with you. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For all things are for your sakes, that the grace abounding through the many may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Wherefore we faint not; but if indeed our outward man is consumed, yet the inward is renewed day by day. <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For our momentary and light affliction works for us in surpassing measure an eternal weight of glory; <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> while we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen are for a time, but those that are not seen eternal.</p>
