<h2>Psalms 124</h2>

<p><a id="c124_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> If it had not been Jehovah who was for us--oh let Israel say-- <a id="c124_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> If it had not been Jehovah who was for us, when men rose up against us, <a id="c124_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Then they had swallowed us up alive, when their anger was kindled against us; <a id="c124_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Then the waters had overwhelmed us, a torrent had gone over our soul; <a id="c124_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.</p>

<p><a id="c124_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Blessed be Jehovah, who gave us not up a prey to their teeth! <a id="c124_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we have escaped. <a id="c124_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Our help is in the name of Jehovah, the maker of heavens and earth.</p>
