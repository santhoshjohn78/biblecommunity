<h2>Psalms 78</h2>

<p><a id="c78_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Give ear, O my people, to my law; incline your ears to the words of my mouth. <a id="c78_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter riddles from of old, <a id="c78_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us: <a id="c78_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> We will not hide them from their sons, shewing forth to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, and his strength, and his marvellous works which he hath done. <a id="c78_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children; <a id="c78_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> That the generation to come might know them, the children that should be born; that they might rise up and tell them to their children, <a id="c78_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And that they might set their hope in God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> and not forget the works of ·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> but observe his commandments; <a id="c78_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that prepared not their heart, and whose spirit was not stedfast with ·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a></p>

<p><a id="c78_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The sons of Ephraim, armed bowmen, turned back in the day of battle. <a id="c78_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> They kept not the covenant of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> and refused to walk in his law; <a id="c78_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And forgot his doings, and his marvellous works which he had shewn them. <a id="c78_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> In the sight of their fathers had he done wonders, in the land of Egypt, the field of Zoan. <a id="c78_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; and made the waters to stand as a heap; <a id="c78_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And he led them with a cloud in the daytime, and all the night with the light of fire. <a id="c78_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> He clave rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the depths, abundantly; <a id="c78_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he brought streams out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. <a id="c78_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Yet they still went on sinning against him, provoking the Most High in the desert; <a id="c78_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And they tempted ·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> in their heart, by asking meat for their lust; <a id="c78_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And they spoke against God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> they said, Is ·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> able to prepare a table in the wilderness? <a id="c78_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Behold, he smote the rock, and waters gushed out, and streams overflowed; is he able to give bread also, or provide flesh for his people? <a id="c78_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; and fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel: <a id="c78_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Because they believed not in God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> and confided not in his salvation; <a id="c78_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of the heavens, <a id="c78_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them the corn of the heavens. <a id="c78_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Man did eat the bread of the mighty; he sent them provision to the full. <a id="c78_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> He caused the east wind to rise in the heavens, and by his strength he brought the south wind; <a id="c78_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And he rained flesh upon them as dust, and feathered fowl as the sand of the seas, <a id="c78_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations: <a id="c78_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And they did eat, and were well filled; for that they lusted after, he brought to them. <a id="c78_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> They were not alienated from their lust, their meat was yet in their mouths, <a id="c78_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> When the anger of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a> went up against them; and he slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. <a id="c78_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> For all this, they sinned still, and believed not in his marvellous works; <a id="c78_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror. <a id="c78_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> When he slew them, then they sought him, and returned and sought early after ·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote10">*</a>  <a id="c78_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And they remembered that God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote11">*</a> was their rock, and ·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote12">*</a> the Most High, their redeemer. <a id="c78_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue; <a id="c78_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> For their heart was not firm toward him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. <a id="c78_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> But he was merciful: he forgave the iniquity, and destroyed them not; but many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his fury: <a id="c78_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And he remembered that they were flesh, a breath that passeth away and cometh not again.</p>

<p><a id="c78_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! <a id="c78_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And they turned again and tempted ·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote13">*</a> and grieved the Holy One of Israel. <a id="c78_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> They remembered not his hand, the day when he delivered them from the oppressor, <a id="c78_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> How he set his signs in Egypt, and his miracles in the field of Zoan; <a id="c78_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> And turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, that they could not drink; <a id="c78_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> He sent dog-flies among them, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them; <a id="c78_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> And he gave their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust; <a id="c78_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with hail-stones; <a id="c78_v48"></a><span class="vn">48</span> And he delivered up their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to thunderbolts. <a id="c78_v49"></a><span class="vn">49</span> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and distress, --a mission of angels of woes. <a id="c78_v50"></a><span class="vn">50</span> He made a way for his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; <a id="c78_v51"></a><span class="vn">51</span> And he smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the first-fruits of their vigour in the tents of Ham. <a id="c78_v52"></a><span class="vn">52</span> And he made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock; <a id="c78_v53"></a><span class="vn">53</span> And he led them safely, so that they were without fear; and the sea covered their enemies. <a id="c78_v54"></a><span class="vn">54</span> And he brought them to his holy border, this mountain, which his right hand purchased; <a id="c78_v55"></a><span class="vn">55</span> And he drove out the nations before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. <a id="c78_v56"></a><span class="vn">56</span> But they tempted and provoked God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote14">*</a> the Most High, and kept not his testimonies, <a id="c78_v57"></a><span class="vn">57</span> And they drew back and dealt treacherously like their fathers: they turned like a deceitful bow. <a id="c78_v58"></a><span class="vn">58</span> And they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. <a id="c78_v59"></a><span class="vn">59</span> God heard, and was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: <a id="c78_v60"></a><span class="vn">60</span> And he forsook the tabernacle at Shiloh, the tent where he had dwelt among men, <a id="c78_v61"></a><span class="vn">61</span> And gave his strength into captivity, and his glory into the hand of the oppressor; <a id="c78_v62"></a><span class="vn">62</span> And delivered up his people unto the sword, and was very wroth with his inheritance: <a id="c78_v63"></a><span class="vn">63</span> The fire consumed their young men, and their maidens were not praised in nuptial song; <a id="c78_v64"></a><span class="vn">64</span> Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation. <a id="c78_v65"></a><span class="vn">65</span> Then the Lord awoke as one out of sleep, like a mighty man that shouteth aloud by reason of wine; <a id="c78_v66"></a><span class="vn">66</span> And he smote his adversaries in the hinder part, and put them to everlasting reproach. <a id="c78_v67"></a><span class="vn">67</span> And he rejected the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, <a id="c78_v68"></a><span class="vn">68</span> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved; <a id="c78_v69"></a><span class="vn">69</span> And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he hath founded for ever. <a id="c78_v70"></a><span class="vn">70</span> And he chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: <a id="c78_v71"></a><span class="vn">71</span> From following the suckling-ewes, he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. <a id="c78_v72"></a><span class="vn">72</span> And he fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and led them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>
