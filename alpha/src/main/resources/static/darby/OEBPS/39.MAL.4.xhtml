<h2>Malachi 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For behold, the day cometh, burning as a furnace; and all the proud and all that work wickedness shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith Jehovah of hosts, so that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth and leap like fatted calves. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I prepare, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and ordinances. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Behold, I send unto you Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and terrible day of Jehovah. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</p>
