<h2>Psalms 7</h2>

<p><a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> in thee have I trusted: save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me; <a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, crushing it while there is no deliverer. <a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jehovah my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> if I have done this, if there be iniquity in my hands; <a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me; (indeed I have freed him that without cause oppressed me;) <a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Let the enemy pursue after my soul, and take it, and let him tread down my life to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah. <a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Arise, Jehovah, in thine anger; lift thyself up against the raging of mine oppressors, and awake for me: thou hast commanded judgment. <a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the assembly of the peoples shall encompass thee; and for their sakes return thou on high. <a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Jehovah shall minister judgment to the peoples. Judge me, Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity which is in me. <a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Oh let the wrong of the wicked come to an end, and establish thou the righteous man; even thou that triest the hearts and reins, the righteous God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a></p>

<p><a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> My shield is with God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> who saveth the upright in heart. <a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> God is a righteous judge, and a Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> who is indignant all the day. <a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> If one turn not, he will sharpen his sword; he hath bent his bow and made it ready, <a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he hath prepared for him instruments of death; his arrows hath he made burning. <a id="c7_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood: <a id="c7_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> He digged a pit, and hollowed it out, and is fallen into the hole that he made. <a id="c7_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own pate. <a id="c7_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> I will praise Jehovah according to his righteousness, and will sing forth the name of Jehovah the Most High.</p>
