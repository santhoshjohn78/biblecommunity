<p><a id="c148_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Hallelujah! Praise Jehovah from the heavens; praise him in the heights. <a id="c148_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Praise ye him, all his angels; praise ye him, all his hosts. <a id="c148_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars of light. <a id="c148_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that are above the heavens. <a id="c148_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Let them praise the name of Jehovah, for he it is that commanded, and they were created: <a id="c148_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he established them for ever and ever; he made for them a statute which shall not pass.</p>

<p><a id="c148_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Praise Jehovah from the earth, ye sea-monsters, and all deeps; <a id="c148_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Fire and hail, snow and vapour, stormy wind fulfilling his word; <a id="c148_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Mountains and all hills, fruit-trees and all cedars; <a id="c148_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Beasts and all cattle, creeping things and winged fowl; <a id="c148_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all judges of the earth; <a id="c148_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Both young men and maidens, old men with youths, -- <a id="c148_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Let them praise the name of Jehovah: for his name alone is exalted; his majesty is above the earth and the heavens. <a id="c148_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And he hath lifted up the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints, even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Hallelujah!</p>
