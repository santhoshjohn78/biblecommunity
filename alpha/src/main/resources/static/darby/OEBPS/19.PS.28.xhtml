<h2>Psalms 28</h2>

<p><a id="c28_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unto thee, Jehovah, do I call; my rock, be not silent unto me, lest, if thou keep silence toward me, I become like them that go down into the pit. <a id="c28_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward the oracle of thy holiness. <a id="c28_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbours, and mischief is in their heart. <a id="c28_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Give them according to their doing, and according to the wickedness of their deeds; give them after the work of their hands, render to them their desert. <a id="c28_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For they regard not the deeds of Jehovah, nor the work of his hands: he will destroy them, and not build them up.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Blessed be Jehovah, for he hath heard the voice of my supplications. <a id="c28_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Jehovah is my strength and my shield; my heart confided in him, and I was helped: therefore my heart exulteth, and with my song will I praise him. <a id="c28_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Jehovah is their strength; and he is the stronghold of salvation to his anointed one. <a id="c28_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance; and feed them, and lift them up for ever.</p>
