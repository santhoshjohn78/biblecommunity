<h2>Jeremiah 47</h2>

<p><a id="c47_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The word of Jehovah that came to the prophet Jeremiah concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh smote Gazah. <a id="c47_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall become an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: and the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl, <a id="c47_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his steeds, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels: fathers shall not look back for their children, from feebleness of hands; <a id="c47_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> because of the day that cometh to lay waste all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper that remaineth; for Jehovah will lay waste the Philistines, the remnant of the island of Caphtor. <a id="c47_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Baldness is come upon Gazah; Ashkelon is cut off, the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself? <a id="c47_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Alas! sword of Jehovah, how long wilt thou not be quiet? Withdraw into thy scabbard, rest, and be still. <a id="c47_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> How shouldest thou be quiet? --For Jehovah hath given it a charge: against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore, there hath he appointed it.</p>
