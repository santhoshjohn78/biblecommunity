<h2>Psalms 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Give ear to my words, O Jehovah; consider my meditation. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Hearken unto the voice of my crying, my king and my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> for to thee will I pray. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; in the morning will I address myself to thee, and will look up. <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For thou art not a Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> that hath pleasure in wickedness; evil shall not sojourn with thee. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Insolent fools shall not stand before thine eyes; thou hatest all workers of iniquity. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: Jehovah abhorreth a man of blood and deceit.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But as for me, in the greatness of thy loving-kindness will I enter thy house; I will bow down toward the temple of thy holiness in thy fear. <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Lead me, Jehovah, in thy righteousness, because of my foes; make thy way plain before me. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For there is no certainty in their mouth; their inward part is perversion, their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Bring guilt upon them, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> let them fall by their own counsels: drive them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against thee. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And all that trust in thee shall rejoice: for ever shall they shout joyously, and thou wilt protect them; and they that love thy name shall exult in thee. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For thou, Jehovah, wilt bless the righteous man; with favour wilt thou surround him as with a shield.</p>
