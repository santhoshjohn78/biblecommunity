<h2>Joshua 23</h2>

<p><a id="c23_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass a long time after that Jehovah had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua had become old, advanced in age, <a id="c23_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am become old, advanced in age; <a id="c23_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and ye have seen all that Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> hath done to all these nations because of you. For Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> is he that hath fought for you. <a id="c23_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Behold, I have divided unto you by lot for an inheritance, according to your tribes, these nations that remain, from the Jordan, as well as all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the great sea toward the sun-setting. <a id="c23_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> he will expel them from before you, and dispossess them from out of your sight; and ye shall take possession of their land, as Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> hath said unto you. <a id="c23_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left; <a id="c23_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> that ye enter not among these nations, these that remain among you; and ye shall make no mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them; <a id="c23_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> but ye shall cleave unto Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> as ye have done unto this day. <a id="c23_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For Jehovah hath dispossessed from before you great and strong nations; and as to you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day. <a id="c23_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> One man of you chaseth a thousand; for Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath said unto you.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Take great heed therefore unto your souls, that ye love Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a>  <a id="c23_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For if ye in any wise go back, and cleave unto the residue of these nations, these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, and come in unto them and they unto you: <a id="c23_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> know for a certainty that Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> will no more dispossess these nations from before you, and they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a> hath given you. <a id="c23_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And behold, I am going this day the way of all the earth; and ye know in all your heart, and in all your soul, that not one thing hath failed of all the good words that Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote10">*</a> hath spoken concerning you: all are come to pass unto you--not one thing hath failed thereof. <a id="c23_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But it shall come to pass, that as every good word hath been fulfilled to you, that Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote11">*</a> spoke to you, so will Jehovah bring upon you every evil word, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote12">*</a> hath given you; <a id="c23_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> when ye transgress the covenant of Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote13">*</a> which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow yourselves unto them, so that the anger of Jehovah shall be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.</p>
