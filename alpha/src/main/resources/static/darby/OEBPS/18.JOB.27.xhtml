<h2>Job 27</h2>

<p><a id="c27_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Job continued his parable and said, <a id="c27_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> As 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> liveth, who hath taken away my right, and the Almighty, who hath embittered my soul, <a id="c27_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of +God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> is in my nostrils, <a id="c27_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> My lips shall not speak unrighteousness, nor my tongue utter deceit! <a id="c27_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Be it far from me that I should justify you; till I die I will not remove my blamelessness from me. <a id="c27_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart reproacheth me not one of my days.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. <a id="c27_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For what is the hope of the ungodly, when God cutteth him off, when +God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> taketh away his soul? <a id="c27_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Will 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> hear his cry when distress cometh upon him? <a id="c27_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Doth he delight himself in the Almighty? will he at all times call upon +God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a></p>

<p><a id="c27_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> I will teach you concerning the hand of 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> what is with the Almighty will I not conceal. <a id="c27_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Behold, ye yourselves have all seen it; and why are ye thus altogether vain? <a id="c27_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> This is the portion of the wicked man with 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> and the heritage of the violent, which they receive from the Almighty: -- <a id="c27_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword, and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread; <a id="c27_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Those that remain of him shall be buried by death, and his widows shall not weep. <a id="c27_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing as the clay; <a id="c27_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on; and the innocent shall divide the silver. <a id="c27_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> He buildeth his house as the moth, and as a booth that a keeper maketh. <a id="c27_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> He lieth down rich, but will do so no more; he openeth his eyes, and he is not. <a id="c27_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Terrors overtake him like waters; a whirlwind stealeth him away in the night. <a id="c27_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> The east wind carrieth him away and he is gone; and as a storm it hurleth him out of his place. <a id="c27_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And God shall cast upon him and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. <a id="c27_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.</p>
