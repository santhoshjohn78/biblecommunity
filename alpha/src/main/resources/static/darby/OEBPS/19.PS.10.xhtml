<h2>Psalms 10</h2>

<p><a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Why, Jehovah, standest thou afar off? Why hidest thou thyself in times of distress? <a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The wicked, in his pride, doth hotly pursue the afflicted. They shall be taken in the devices that they have imagined. <a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For the wicked boasteth of his soul's desire, and he blesseth the covetous; he contemneth Jehovah. <a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The wicked saith, in the haughtiness of his countenance, He doth not search out: all his thoughts are, There is no God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a>  <a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> His ways always succeed; thy judgments are far above out of his sight; as for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them. <a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved; from generation to generation I shall be in no adversity. <a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> His mouth is full of cursing, and deceit, and oppression; under his tongue is mischief and iniquity. <a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; in the secret places doth he slay the innocent: his eyes watch for the wretched. <a id="c10_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He lieth in wait secretly, like a lion in his thicket; he lieth in wait to catch the afflicted: he doth catch the afflicted, drawing him into his net. <a id="c10_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> He croucheth, he boweth down, that the wretched may fall by his strong ones. <a id="c10_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> He saith in his heart, ·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> hath forgotten, he hideth his face, he will never see it.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Arise, Jehovah; O ·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> lift up thy hand: forget not the afflicted. <a id="c10_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> He hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it. <a id="c10_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Thou hast seen it, for thou thyself beholdest trouble and vexation, to requite by thy hand. The wretched committeth himself unto thee; thou hast been the helper of the fatherless. <a id="c10_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Break thou the arm of the wicked, and as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none. <a id="c10_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Jehovah is King for ever and ever: the nations have perished out of his land. <a id="c10_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Jehovah, thou hast heard the desire of the meek, thou hast established their heart: thou causest thine ear to hear, <a id="c10_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> To do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed one, that the man of the earth may terrify no more.</p>
