<h2>Jeremiah 41</h2>

<p><a id="c41_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, and one of the king's chief men, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam unto Mizpah, and there they ate bread together, in Mizpah. <a id="c41_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land. <a id="c41_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Ishmael smote all the Jews that were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, the men of war. <a id="c41_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And it came to pass the second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and no man knew it, <a id="c41_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty men, having their beards shaven and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves; with oblations and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah. <a id="c41_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went; and it came to pass when he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. <a id="c41_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, he and the men that were with him, slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit. <a id="c41_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Do not kill us, for we have hidden stores in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbore, and did not kill them among their brethren. <a id="c41_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of Gedaliah was the one which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain. <a id="c41_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Ishmael carried away captive all the remnant of the people that were in Mizpah, the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.</p>

<p><a id="c41_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done; <a id="c41_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are at Gibeon. <a id="c41_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And it came to pass when all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad. <a id="c41_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. <a id="c41_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon. <a id="c41_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon; <a id="c41_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and they departed, and dwelt at Geruth-Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt, <a id="c41_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> because of the Chaldeans; for they feared them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had smitten Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.</p>
