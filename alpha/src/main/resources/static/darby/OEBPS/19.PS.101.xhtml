<h2>Psalms 101</h2>

<p><a id="c101_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I will sing of loving-kindness and judgment: unto thee, Jehovah, will I sing psalms. <a id="c101_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. When wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart. <a id="c101_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I will set no thing of Belial before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me. <a id="c101_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will not know evil. <a id="c101_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Whoso secretly slandereth his neighbour, him will I destroy; him that hath a high look and a proud heart will I not suffer. <a id="c101_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. <a id="c101_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He that practiseth deceit shall not dwell within my house; he that speaketh falsehoods shall not subsist in my sight. <a id="c101_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Every morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land: to cut off all workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah.</p>
