<h2>Ecclesiastes 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> and draw near to hear, rather than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they know not that they do evil. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> for God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> is in the heavens, and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For a dream cometh through the multitude of business, and a fool's voice through a multitude of words.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> When thou vowest a vow unto God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an inadvertence. Wherefore should God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> be wroth at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands? <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For in the multitude of dreams are vanities; so with many words: but fear God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a>  <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter; for a higher than the high is watching, and there are higher than they.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Moreover the earth is every way profitable: the king himself is dependent upon the field. <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver, nor he that loveth abundance with increase. This also is vanity. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> When goods increase, they are increased that eat them; and what profit is there to the owner thereof, except the beholding of them with his eyes? <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The sleep of the labourer is sweet, whether he have eaten little or much; but the fulness of the rich doth not suffer him to sleep. <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt; <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> or those riches perish by some evil circumstance, and if he have begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand. <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he go away again as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came so doth he go away, and what profit hath he, in having laboured for the wind? <a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> All his days also he eateth in darkness, and hath much vexation, and sickness, and irritation.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Behold what I have seen good and comely: it is to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labour wherewith man laboureth under the sun, all the days of his life which God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> hath given him: for that is his portion. <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Every man also to whom God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> hath given riches and wealth, and power to eat thereof, and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour: that is a gift of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a>  <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For he will not much remember the days of his life, because God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote10">*</a> answereth him with the joy of his heart.</p>
