<h2>Zechariah 9</h2>

<p><a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The burden of the word of Jehovah, in the land of Hadrach, and on Damascus shall it rest; (for Jehovah hath an eye upon men, and upon all the tribes of Israel;) <a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and also on Hamath which bordereth thereon; on Tyre and Zidon, though she be very wise. <a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Tyre hath built herself a stronghold, and hath heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. <a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Behold, the Lord will take possession of her, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. <a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gazah also, and she shall be greatly pained; Ekron also, for her expectation shall be put to shame: and the king shall perish from Gazah, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. <a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines; <a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; but he that remaineth, he also shall belong to our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> and shall be as a leader in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite. <a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I will encamp about my house because of the army, because of those that pass by and that return; and the exactor shall not pass through them any more: for now have I seen it with mine eyes.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion; shout, daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, thy King cometh to thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass. <a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle-bow shall be cut off. And he shall speak peace unto the nations; and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth. <a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant, I will send forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Turn again to the stronghold, prisoners of hope! even to-day do I declare I will render double unto thee. <a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim; and I will raise up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and make thee like the sword of a mighty man. <a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Jehovah shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, and will march with whirlwinds of the south. <a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Jehovah of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as from wine; and they shall be filled like a bowl, like the corners of the altar. <a id="c9_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Jehovah their God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> shall save them in that day as the flock of his people; for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up upon his land. <a id="c9_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! Corn shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the maidens.</p>
