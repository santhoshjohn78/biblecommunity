<h2>2 Samuel 22</h2>

<p><a id="c22_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And David spoke to Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he said, Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; <a id="c22_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> God is my rock, in him will I trust--My shield, and the horn of my salvation, My high tower, and my refuge, My saviour: thou wilt save me from violence. <a id="c22_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I will call upon Jehovah, who is to be praised; So shall I be saved from mine enemies. <a id="c22_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For the waves of death encompassed me, Torrents of Belial made me afraid. <a id="c22_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The bands of Sheol surrounded me; The cords of death encountered me; <a id="c22_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> In my distress I called upon Jehovah, And I cried to my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> And he heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry came into his ears. <a id="c22_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Then the earth shook, and quaked; The foundations of the heavens trembled And shook because he was wroth. <a id="c22_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals burned forth from it. <a id="c22_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he bowed the heavens, and came down; And darkness was under his feet. <a id="c22_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; And he was seen upon the wings of the wind. <a id="c22_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And he made darkness round about him a tent, Gatherings of waters, thick clouds of the skies. <a id="c22_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> From the brightness before him Burned forth coals of fire. <a id="c22_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Jehovah thundered from the heavens, And the Most High uttered his voice. <a id="c22_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he sent arrows, and scattered mine enemies; Lightning, and discomfited them. <a id="c22_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the beds of the sea were seen, The foundations of the world were uncovered At the rebuke of Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils. <a id="c22_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He reached forth from above, he took me, He drew me out of great waters; <a id="c22_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> He delivered me from my strong enemy, From them that hated me; For they were mightier than I. <a id="c22_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> They encountered me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay. <a id="c22_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And he brought me forth into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me. <a id="c22_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. <a id="c22_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a>  <a id="c22_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> For all his ordinances were before me, And his statutes, I did not depart from them, <a id="c22_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And I was upright before him, And kept myself from mine iniquity. <a id="c22_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Jehovah hath recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his sight. <a id="c22_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> With the gracious thou dost shew thyself gracious; With the upright man thou dost shew thyself upright; <a id="c22_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> With the pure thou dost shew thyself pure; And with the perverse thou dost shew thyself contrary. <a id="c22_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And the afflicted people thou dost save; And thine eyes are upon the haughty, whom thou bringest down. <a id="c22_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> For thou art my lamp, Jehovah; And Jehovah enlighteneth my darkness. <a id="c22_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> For by thee I have run through a troop; By my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> have I leaped over a wall. <a id="c22_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> As for 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> his way is perfect; The word of Jehovah is tried: He is a shield to all that trust in him. <a id="c22_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> For who is 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> save Jehovah? And who is a rock, save our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a>  <a id="c22_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> is my strong fortress, And he maketh my way perfectly smooth. <a id="c22_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, And setteth me upon my high places. <a id="c22_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> He teacheth my hands to war, And mine arms bend a bow of brass. <a id="c22_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And thou didst give me the shield of thy salvation, And thy condescending gentleness hath made me great. <a id="c22_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> Thou enlargedst my steps under me; And mine ankles did not slip. <a id="c22_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> I pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them, And I turned not again till they were consumed. <a id="c22_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And I have consumed them and have crushed them, and they rose not again; Yea, they fell under my feet. <a id="c22_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And thou girdedst me with strength to battle: Thou didst subdue under me those that rose up against me. <a id="c22_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And mine enemies didst thou make to turn their backs unto me, And those that hated me I destroyed. <a id="c22_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> They looked, and there was none to save--Unto Jehovah, and he answered them not. <a id="c22_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> And I did beat them small as the dust of the earth, I trod them as the mire of the streets; I stamped upon them. <a id="c22_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> And thou hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, Thou hast kept me to be head of the nations: A people I knew not doth serve me: <a id="c22_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> Strangers come cringing unto me: At the hearing of the ear, they obey me. <a id="c22_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> Strangers have faded away, And they come trembling forth from their close places. <a id="c22_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> the rock of my salvation, <a id="c22_v48"></a><span class="vn">48</span> The 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a> who hath avenged me, And hath brought the peoples under me. <a id="c22_v49"></a><span class="vn">49</span> He brought me forth from mine enemies: Yea, thou hast lifted me up above them that rose up against me; From the man of violence hast thou delivered me. <a id="c22_v50"></a><span class="vn">50</span> Therefore will I give thanks to thee, Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing psalms to thy name. <a id="c22_v51"></a><span class="vn">51</span> It is he who giveth great deliverances to his king, And sheweth loving-kindness to his anointed, To David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>
