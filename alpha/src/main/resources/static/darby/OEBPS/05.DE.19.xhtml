<h2>Deuteronomy 19</h2>

<p><a id="c19_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> When Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> hath cut off the nations whose land Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> giveth thee, and thou hast dispossessed them, and dwellest in their cities and in their houses, <a id="c19_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> thou shalt separate three cities for thyself in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> giveth thee to possess. <a id="c19_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thou shalt prepare thee the way, and divide the territory of thy land, which Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, so that every slayer may flee thither. <a id="c19_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And this is the case of the slayer who shall flee thither that he may live: he that smiteth his neighbour unwittingly, whom he hated not previously; <a id="c19_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> as when he goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the iron slippeth from the handle, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; such an one shall flee unto one of these cities, and live; <a id="c19_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, since he hated him not previously. <a id="c19_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thyself. <a id="c19_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And if Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> enlarge thy border, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers <a id="c19_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> (if thou keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> and to walk in his ways continually), then shalt thou add three cities more for thyself to these three, <a id="c19_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land which Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> giveth thee for an inheritance, and blood come not upon thee. <a id="c19_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But if a man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and he flee into one of these cities, <a id="c19_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. <a id="c19_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Thine eye shall not spare him; and thou shalt put away innocent blood from Israel, that it may be well with thee.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old time have fixed in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land which Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> giveth thee to possess. <a id="c19_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, and for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established. <a id="c19_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of an offence; <a id="c19_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> then both the men between whom the controversy is shall stand before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days; <a id="c19_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and the judges shall make thorough inquiry; and if the witness be a false witness, and he have testified falsely against his brother, <a id="c19_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother; and thou shalt put evil away from thy midst. <a id="c19_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And those that remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in thy midst. <a id="c19_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And thine eye shall not spare: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.</p>
