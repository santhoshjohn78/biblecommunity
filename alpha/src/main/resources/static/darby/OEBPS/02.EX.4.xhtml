<h2>Exodus 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Moses answered and said, But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, Jehovah has not appeared to thee. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Jehovah said to him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A staff. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand and take it by the tail--and he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand-- <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> that they may believe that Jehovah, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of their fathers, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of Abraham, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> of Isaac, and the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Jehovah said moreover to him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom, and took it out, and behold, his hand was leprous, as snow. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again, and took it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his flesh. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the other sign. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also those two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land; and the water that thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Moses said to Jehovah, Ah Lord! I am not eloquent, neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken to thy servant, for I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Jehovah said to him, Who gave man a mouth? or who maketh dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? have not I, Jehovah? <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And now go, and I will be with thy mouth, and will teach thee what thou shalt say. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he said, Ah Lord! send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Then the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also behold, he goeth out to meet thee; and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he shall speak for thee unto the people; and it shall come to pass that he shall be to thee for a mouth, and thou shalt be to him for God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a>  <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And thou shalt take this staff in thy hand, with which thou shalt do the signs.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my brethren who are in Egypt, that I may see whether they are yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. <a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian, Go, return to Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought thy life. <a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them riding upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> in his hand. <a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Jehovah said to Moses, When thou goest to return to Egypt, see that thou do all the wonders before Pharaoh that I have put in thy hand. And I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. <a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah: Israel is my son, my firstborn. <a id="c4_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me. And if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill thy son, thy firstborn.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And it came to pass on the way, in the inn, that Jehovah came upon him, and sought to slay him. <a id="c4_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Then Zipporah took a stone and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, A bloody husband indeed art thou to me! <a id="c4_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And he let him go. Then she said, A bloody husband--because of the circumcision. <a id="c4_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him on the mountain of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> and kissed him. <a id="c4_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah who had sent him, and all the signs that he had commanded him. <a id="c4_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the children of Israel; <a id="c4_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and Aaron spoke all the words that Jehovah had spoken to Moses, and did the signs before the eyes of the people. <a id="c4_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And the people believed. And when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</p>
