<h2>Psalms 38</h2>

<p><a id="c38_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah, rebuke me not in thy wrath; neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. <a id="c38_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand cometh down upon me. <a id="c38_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation; no peace in my bones, because of my sin. <a id="c38_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For mine iniquities are gone over my head: as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me. <a id="c38_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> My wounds stink, they are corrupt, because of my foolishness. <a id="c38_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I am depressed; I am bowed down beyond measure; I go mourning all the day. <a id="c38_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For my loins are full of burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh. <a id="c38_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I am faint and broken beyond measure; I roar by reason of the agitation of my heart. <a id="c38_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my sighing is not hid from thee. <a id="c38_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> My heart throbbeth, my strength hath left me; and the light of mine eyes, it also is no more with me. <a id="c38_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> My lovers and mine associates stand aloof from my stroke; and my kinsmen stand afar off.</p>

<p><a id="c38_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And they that seek after my life lay snares for me; and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and meditate deceits all the day long. <a id="c38_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But I, as a deaf man, hear not; and am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. <a id="c38_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Yea, I am as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs. <a id="c38_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For in thee, Jehovah, do I hope: thou wilt answer, O Lord my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a>  <a id="c38_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> For I said, Let them not rejoice over me! When my foot slipped, they magnified themselves against me. <a id="c38_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For I am ready to halt, and my pain is continually before me. <a id="c38_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For I will declare mine iniquity, I am grieved for my sin. <a id="c38_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> But mine enemies are lively, they are strong; and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied: <a id="c38_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And they that render evil for good are adversaries unto me; because I pursue what is good. <a id="c38_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Forsake me not, Jehovah; O my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> be not far from me. <a id="c38_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.</p>
