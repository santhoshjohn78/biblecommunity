<h2>Ephesians 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, to the saints and faithful in Christ Jesus who are at Ephesus. <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ; <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> according as he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love; <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved: <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of offences, according to the riches of his grace; <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> which he has caused to abound towards us in all wisdom and intelligence, <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for the administration of the fulness of times; to head up all things in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth; in him, <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> in whom we have also obtained an inheritance, being marked out beforehand according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his own will, <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> that we should be to the praise of his glory who have pre-trusted in the Christ: <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> in whom ye also have trusted, having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> who is the earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquired possession to the praise of his glory.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Wherefore I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is in you, and the love which ye have towards all the saints, <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you at my prayers, <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him, <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> being enlightened in the eyes of your heart, so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, <a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and what the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength, <a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> in which he wrought in the Christ in raising him from among the dead, and he set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies, <a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> above every principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name named, not only in this age, but also in that to come; <a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the assembly, <a id="c1_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all:</p>
