<h2>Psalms 69</h2>

<p><a id="c69_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Save me, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> for the waters are come in unto my soul. <a id="c69_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing; I am come into the depths of waters, and the flood overfloweth me. <a id="c69_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I am weary with my crying, my throat is parched; mine eyes fail while I wait for my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a>  <a id="c69_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away. <a id="c69_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thou, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> knowest my foolishness, and my trespasses are not hidden from thee. <a id="c69_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let not them that wait on thee, Lord, Jehovah of hosts, be ashamed through me; let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> of Israel. <a id="c69_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; confusion hath covered my face. <a id="c69_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's sons; <a id="c69_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For the zeal of thy house hath devoured me, and the reproaches of them that reproach thee have fallen upon me. <a id="c69_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And I wept, my soul was fasting: that also was to my reproach; -- <a id="c69_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And I made sackcloth my garment: then I became a proverb to them. <a id="c69_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> They that sit in the gate talk of me, and I am the song of the drunkards.</p>

<p><a id="c69_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, Jehovah, in an acceptable time: O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> in the abundance of thy loving-kindness answer me, according to the truth of thy salvation: <a id="c69_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Deliver me out of the mire, let me not sink; let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the depths of waters. <a id="c69_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Let not the flood of waters overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up; and let not the pit shut its mouth upon me. <a id="c69_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy loving-kindness is good: according to the abundance of thy tender mercies, turn toward me; <a id="c69_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: answer me speedily. <a id="c69_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Draw nigh unto my soul, be its redeemer; ransom me because of mine enemies. <a id="c69_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee. <a id="c69_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am overwhelmed: and I looked for sympathy, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none. <a id="c69_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Yea, they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>

<p><a id="c69_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Let their table become a snare before them, and their very welfare a trap; <a id="c69_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not, and make their loins continually to shake. <a id="c69_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of thine anger take hold of them. <a id="c69_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Let their habitation be desolate; let there be no dweller in their tents. <a id="c69_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten, and they talk for the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded. <a id="c69_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Add iniquity unto their iniquity, and let them not come into thy righteousness. <a id="c69_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous. <a id="c69_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> But I am afflicted and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> set me secure on high.</p>

<p><a id="c69_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> I will praise the name of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving; <a id="c69_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And it shall please Jehovah more than an ox, --a bullock with horns and cloven hoofs. <a id="c69_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> The meek shall see it, they shall be glad; ye that seek God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> your heart shall live. <a id="c69_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> For Jehovah heareth the needy, and despiseth not his prisoners. <a id="c69_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Let heavens and earth praise him; the seas, and everything that moveth therein. <a id="c69_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> For God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a> will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah; and they shall dwell there, and possess it: <a id="c69_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And the seed of his servants shall inherit it, and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</p>
