<h2>Psalms 126</h2>

<p><a id="c126_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> When Jehovah turned the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. <a id="c126_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with rejoicing: then said they among the nations, Jehovah hath done great things for them. <a id="c126_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jehovah hath done great things for us; and we are joyful.</p>

<p><a id="c126_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Turn our captivity, O Jehovah, as the streams in the south. <a id="c126_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They that sow in tears shall reap with rejoicing: <a id="c126_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for scattering; he cometh again with rejoicing, bearing his sheaves.</p>
