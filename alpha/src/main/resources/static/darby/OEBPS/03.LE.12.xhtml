<h2>Leviticus 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman conceive seed, and bear a male, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the separation of her infirmity shall she be unclean. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And on the eighth day shall the flesh of his foreskin be circumcised. <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And she shall continue thirty-three days in the blood of her cleansing; no holy thing shall she touch, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her cleansing are fulfilled. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And if she bear a female, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation; and she shall continue sixty-six days in the blood of her cleansing.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And when the days of her cleansing are fulfilled, for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring a yearling lamb for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle-dove for a sin-offering, to the entrance of the tent of meeting, unto the priest. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And he shall present it before Jehovah, and make atonement for her; and she shall be clean from the flux of her blood. This is the law for her that hath borne a male or a female. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And if her hand cannot find what is sufficient for a sheep, she shall bring two turtle-doves or two young pigeons; one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her; and she shall be clean.</p>
