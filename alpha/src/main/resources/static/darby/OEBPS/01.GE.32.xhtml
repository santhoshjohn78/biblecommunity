<h2>Genesis 32</h2>

<p><a id="c32_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jacob went on his way; and the angels of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> met him. <a id="c32_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And when Jacob saw them he said, This is the camp of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</p>

<p><a id="c32_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Jacob sent messengers before his face to Esau his brother, into the land of Seir, the fields of Edom. <a id="c32_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak to my lord, to Esau: Thy servant Jacob speaks thus--With Laban have I sojourned and tarried until now; <a id="c32_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and I have oxen, and asses, sheep, and bondmen, and bondwomen; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in thine eyes. <a id="c32_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother, to Esau; and he also is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. <a id="c32_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Then Jacob was greatly afraid, and was distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the sheep and the cattle and the camels, into two troops. <a id="c32_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he said, If Esau come to the one troop and smite it, then the other troop which is left shall escape.</p>

<p><a id="c32_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Jacob said, God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> of my father Abraham, and God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> of my father Isaac, Jehovah, who saidst unto me: Return into thy country and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good, <a id="c32_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> --I am too small for all the loving-kindness and all the faithfulness that thou hast shewn unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two troops. <a id="c32_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, and the mother with the children. <a id="c32_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And thou saidst, I will certainly deal well with thee, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</p>

<p><a id="c32_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he lodged there that night; and took of what came to his hand a gift for Esau his brother-- <a id="c32_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats; two hundred ewes, and twenty rams; <a id="c32_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> thirty milch camels with their colts; forty kine, and ten bulls; twenty she-asses, and ten young asses. <a id="c32_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and put a space between drove and drove. <a id="c32_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets thee, and asks thee, saying, Whose art thou, and where goest thou, and whose are these before thee? <a id="c32_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> --then thou shalt say, Thy servant Jacob's: it is a gift sent to my lord, to Esau. And behold, he also is behind us. <a id="c32_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, According to this word shall ye speak to Esau when ye find him. <a id="c32_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And, moreover, ye shall say, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will propitiate him with the gift that goes before me, and afterwards I will see his face: perhaps he will accept me. <a id="c32_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the gift went over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp. <a id="c32_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok; <a id="c32_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and he took them and led them over the river, and led over what he had.</p>

<p><a id="c32_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Jacob remained alone; and a man wrestled with him until the rising of the dawn. <a id="c32_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And when he saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the joint of his thigh; and the joint of Jacob's thigh was dislocated as he wrestled with him. <a id="c32_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And he said, Let me go, for the dawn ariseth. And he said, I will not let thee go except thou bless me. <a id="c32_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. <a id="c32_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And he said, Thy name shall not henceforth be called Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast wrestled with God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> and with men, and hast prevailed. <a id="c32_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Jacob asked and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, How is it that thou askest after my name? And he blessed him there. <a id="c32_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel--For I have seen God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> face to face, and my life has been preserved. <a id="c32_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And as he passed over Peniel, the sun rose upon him; and he limped upon his hip. <a id="c32_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> Therefore the children of Israel do not eat of the sinew that is over the joint of the thigh, to this day; because he touched the joint of Jacob's thigh--the sinew.</p>
