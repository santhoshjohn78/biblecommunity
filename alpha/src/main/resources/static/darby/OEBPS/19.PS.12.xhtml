<h2>Psalms 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Save, Jehovah, for the godly man is gone; for the faithful have failed from among the children of men. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> They speak falsehood every one with his neighbour: with flattering lip, with a double heart, do they speak. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaketh proud things, <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail, our lips are our own: who is lord over us? <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Because of the oppression of the afflicted, because of the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith Jehovah, I will set him in safety, at whom they puff. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The words of Jehovah are pure words, silver tried in the furnace of earth, purified seven times. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Thou, Jehovah, wilt keep them, thou wilt preserve them from this generation for ever. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The wicked walk about on every side, when vileness is exalted among the children of men.</p>
