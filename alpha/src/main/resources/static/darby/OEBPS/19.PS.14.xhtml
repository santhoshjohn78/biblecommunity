<h2>Psalms 14</h2>

<p><a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> They have corrupted themselves, they have done abominable works: there is none that doeth good. <a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah looked down from the heavens upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a>  <a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> They have all gone aside, they are together become corrupt: there is none that doeth good, not even one.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, eating up my people as they eat bread? They call not upon Jehovah. <a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> There were they in great fear; for God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> is in the generation of the righteous. <a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Ye have shamed the counsel of the afflicted, because Jehovah was his refuge. <a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Jehovah turneth again the captivity of his people, Jacob shall be glad, Israel shall rejoice.</p>
