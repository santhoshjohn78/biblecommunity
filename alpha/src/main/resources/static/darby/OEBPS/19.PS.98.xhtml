<p><a id="c98_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Sing ye unto Jehovah a new song: for he hath done wondrous things; his right hand and his holy arm hath wrought salvation for him. <a id="c98_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the nations. <a id="c98_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He hath remembered his loving-kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a></p>

<p><a id="c98_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Shout aloud unto Jehovah, all the earth; break forth and shout for joy, and sing psalms. <a id="c98_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Sing psalms unto Jehovah with the harp: with the harp, and the voice of a song; <a id="c98_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> With trumpets and sound of cornet, make a joyful noise before the King, Jehovah. <a id="c98_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein; <a id="c98_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Let the floods clap their hands; let the mountains sing for joy together, <a id="c98_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Before Jehovah, for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.</p>
