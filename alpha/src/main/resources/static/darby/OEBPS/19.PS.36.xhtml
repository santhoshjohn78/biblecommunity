<h2>Psalms 36</h2>

<p><a id="c36_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The transgression of the wicked uttereth within my heart, There is no fear of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> before his eyes. <a id="c36_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, even when his iniquity is found to be hateful. <a id="c36_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, to do good. <a id="c36_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He deviseth wickedness up on his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good: he abhorreth not evil.</p>

<p><a id="c36_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Jehovah, thy loving-kindness is in the heavens, and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds. <a id="c36_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thy righteousness is like the high mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: thou, Jehovah, preservest man and beast. <a id="c36_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> How precious is thy loving-kindness, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> So the sons of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings. <a id="c36_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou wilt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. <a id="c36_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light. <a id="c36_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Continue thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee, and thy righteousness to the upright in heart; <a id="c36_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. <a id="c36_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and are not able to rise.</p>
