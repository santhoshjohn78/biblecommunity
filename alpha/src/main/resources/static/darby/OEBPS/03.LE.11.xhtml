<h2>Leviticus 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them, <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the animals which ye shall eat of all the beasts which are on the earth. <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Whatever hath cloven hoofs, and feet quite split open, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts--that shall ye eat. <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Only these shall ye not eat of those that chew the cud, or of those with cloven hoofs: the camel, for it cheweth the cud, but hath not cloven hoofs--it shall be unclean unto you; <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and the rock-badger, for it cheweth the cud, but hath not cloven hoofs--it shall be unclean unto you; <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and the hare, for it cheweth the cud, but hath not cloven hoofs--it shall be unclean unto you; <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and the swine, for it hath cloven hoofs, and feet quite split open, but it cheweth not the cud--it shall be unclean unto you. <a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch: they shall be unclean unto you.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatever hath fins and scales in waters, in seas and in rivers, these shall ye eat; <a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> but all that have not fins and scales in seas and in rivers, of all that swarm in the waters, and of every living soul which is in the waters--they shall be an abomination unto you. <a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> They shall be even an abomination unto you: of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase ye shall have in abomination. <a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Whatever in the waters hath no fins and scales, that shall be an abomination unto you. <a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And these shall ye have in abomination of the fowls; they shall not be eaten; an abomination shall they be: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the sea-eagle, <a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and the falcon, and the kite, after its kind; <a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> every raven after its kind; <a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and the female ostrich and the male ostrich, and the sea-gull, and the hawk, after its kind; <a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and the owl, and the gannet, and the ibis, <a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and the swan, and the pelican, and the carrion vulture, <a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and the stork; the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Every winged crawling thing that goeth upon all four shall be an abomination unto you. <a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Yet these shall ye eat of every winged crawling thing that goeth upon all four: those which have legs above their feet with which to leap upon the earth. <a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> These shall ye eat of them: the arbeh after its kind, and the solam after its kind, and the hargol after its kind, and the hargab after its kind. <a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> But every winged crawling thing that hath four feet shall be an abomination unto you. <a id="c11_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And by these ye shall make yourselves unclean; whoever toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even. <a id="c11_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And whoever carrieth ought of their carcase shall wash his garments, and be unclean until the even. <a id="c11_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Every beast that hath cloven hoofs, but not feet quite split open, nor cheweth the cud, shall be unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean. <a id="c11_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And whatever goeth on its paws, among all manner of beasts that go upon all four, those are unclean unto you: whoever toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even. <a id="c11_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And he that carrieth their carcase shall wash his garments, and be unclean until the even: they shall be unclean unto you. <a id="c11_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And these shall be unclean unto you among the crawling things which crawl on the earth: the mole, and the field-mouse, and the lizard, after its kind; <a id="c11_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> and the groaning lizard, and the great red lizard, and the climbing lizard, and the chomet, and the chameleon. <a id="c11_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> These shall be unclean unto you among all that crawl: whoever toucheth them when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even. <a id="c11_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And on whatever any of them when they are dead doth fall, it shall be unclean; all vessels of wood, or garment, or skin, or sack, every vessel wherewith work is done--it shall be put into water, and be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean. <a id="c11_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And every earthen vessel into which any of them falleth--whatever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it. <a id="c11_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> All food that is eaten on which such water hath come shall be unclean; and all drink that is drunk shall be unclean, in every such vessel. <a id="c11_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And everything where upon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; oven and hearth shall be broken down: they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you. <a id="c11_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Nevertheless, a spring or a well, a quantity of water, shall be clean. But he that toucheth their carcase shall be unclean. <a id="c11_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing-seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean; <a id="c11_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> but if water have been put on the seed, and any part of their carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you. <a id="c11_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And if any beast which is to you for food die, he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even. <a id="c11_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And he that eateth of its carcase shall wash his garments, and be unclean until the even: he also that carrieth its carcase shall wash his garments, and be unclean until the even. <a id="c11_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And every crawling thing which crawleth on the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten. <a id="c11_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> Whatever goeth on the belly, and whatever goeth on all four, and all that have a great many feet, of every manner of crawling thing which crawleth on the earth--these ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> Ye shall not make yourselves abominable through any crawling thing which crawleth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby. <a id="c11_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> For I am Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> and ye shall hallow yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy; and ye shall not make yourselves unclean through any manner of crawling thing which creepeth on the earth. <a id="c11_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> For I am Jehovah who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy. <a id="c11_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> This is the law of cattle, and of fowl, and of every living soul that moveth in the waters, and of every soul that crawleth on the earth; <a id="c11_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> to make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that is to be eaten and the beast that is not to be eaten.</p>
