<p><a id="c12_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to hold the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, lutes and harps. <a id="c12_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And the children of the singers were assembled, both from the plain of Jordan round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites, <a id="c12_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> also from Beth-Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built themselves hamlets round about Jerusalem. <a id="c12_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates and the wall. <a id="c12_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great choirs and processions, on the right hand upon the wall towards the dung-gate. <a id="c12_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah, <a id="c12_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, <a id="c12_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Judah and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, <a id="c12_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> and certain of the priests' sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph; <a id="c12_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azareel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> and Ezra the scribe before them. <a id="c12_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And at the fountain-gate, and over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate eastward. <a id="c12_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And the second choir went in the opposite direction upon the wall, and I after them, and the half of the people, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall; <a id="c12_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> and from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the gate of the old wall, and above the fish-gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep-gate; and they stood still in the prison-gate. <a id="c12_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And both choirs stood in the house of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> and I, and the half of the rulers with me; <a id="c12_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah, with trumpets; <a id="c12_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud; and Jizrahiah was their overseer. <a id="c12_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> And that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> had made them rejoice with great joy; and also the women and the children rejoiced. And the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> And at that time men were appointed over the chambers of the treasures for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, out of the fields of the cities, the portions assigned by the law for the priests and the Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests, and over the Levites that waited. <a id="c12_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> And, with the singers and the doorkeepers, they kept the ward of their God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David and of Solomon his son. <a id="c12_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> For of old, in the days of David and Asaph, there were the chiefs of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgivings to God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a>  <a id="c12_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> And all Israel, in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the doorkeepers, every day what was needed, and they consecrated things for the Levites; and the Levites consecrated for the children of Aaron.</p>
