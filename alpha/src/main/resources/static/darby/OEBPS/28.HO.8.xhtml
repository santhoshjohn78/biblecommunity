<h2>Hosea 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He cometh as an eagle against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed my covenant, and rebelled against my law. <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> They shall cry unto me, My God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> we know thee; we, Israel. <a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Israel hath cast off good: the enemy shall pursue him. <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not; of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will they be incapable of purity? <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For from Israel is this also: --a workman made it, and it is no God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> for the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk; should it sprout, it would yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Israel is swallowed up: now are they become among the nations as a vessel wherein is no pleasure. <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For they are gone up to Assyria as a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers. <a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Although they hire among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall begin to be straitened under the burden of the king of princes. <a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin. <a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> I have prescribed unto him the manifold things of my law: they are counted as a strange thing. <a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; Jehovah hath no delight in them. Now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt. <a id="c8_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</p>
