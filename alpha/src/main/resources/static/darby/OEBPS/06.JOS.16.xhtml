<h2>Joshua 16</h2>

<p><a id="c16_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the lot came forth for the children of Joseph from the Jordan of Jericho as far as the waters of Jericho eastwards, to the wilderness which goes up from Jericho to the hill-country of Bethel. <a id="c16_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And the border went from Bethel to Luz, and passed to the border of the Archites to Ataroth, <a id="c16_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, as far as the border of the lower Beth-horon, and to Gezer; and ended at the sea. <a id="c16_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the border of the children of Ephraim was according to their families; the border of their inheritance eastwards was Ataroth-Addar as far as the upper Beth-horon; <a id="c16_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and the border went forth westwards to Micmethath on the north; and the border turned eastwards to Taanath-Shiloh, and passed by it eastwards to Janohah, <a id="c16_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and went down from Janohah to Ataroth and Naarath, and touched upon Jericho, and went out to the Jordan. <a id="c16_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> From Tappuah the border went westwards to the torrent Kanah, and ended at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families, <a id="c16_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> with the cities that were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities and their hamlets. <a id="c16_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But they did not dispossess the Canaanites that dwelt at Gezer; and the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day, and serve under tribute.</p>
