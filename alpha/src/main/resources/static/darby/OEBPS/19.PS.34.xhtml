<h2>Psalms 34</h2>

<p><a id="c34_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I will bless Jehovah at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth. <a id="c34_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> My soul shall make its boast in Jehovah: the meek shall hear, and rejoice. <a id="c34_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Magnify Jehovah with me, and let us exalt his name together. <a id="c34_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I sought Jehovah, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears. <a id="c34_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They looked unto him, and were enlightened, and their faces were not confounded. <a id="c34_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> This afflicted one called, and Jehovah heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. <a id="c34_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. <a id="c34_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Taste and see that Jehovah is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him! <a id="c34_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Fear Jehovah, ye his saints; for there is no want to them that fear him. <a id="c34_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The young lions are in need and suffer hunger; but they that seek Jehovah shall not want any good.</p>

<p><a id="c34_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Come, ye sons, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of Jehovah. <a id="c34_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> What man is he that desireth life, and loveth days, that he may see good? <a id="c34_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile; <a id="c34_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. <a id="c34_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous, and his ears are toward their cry; <a id="c34_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The face of Jehovah is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth: <a id="c34_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The righteous cry, and Jehovah heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles. <a id="c34_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Jehovah is nigh to those that are of a broken heart, and saveth them that are of a contrite spirit. <a id="c34_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Many are the adversities of the righteous, but Jehovah delivereth him out of them all: <a id="c34_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> He keepeth all his bones; not one of them is broken. <a id="c34_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Evil shall destroy the wicked; and they that hate the righteous shall bear their guilt. <a id="c34_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Jehovah redeemeth the soul of his servants; and none of them that trust in him shall bear guilt.</p>
