<h2>Psalms 73</h2>

<p><a id="c73_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Truly God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> is good to Israel, to such as are of a pure heart. <a id="c73_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> But as for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh slipped; <a id="c73_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For I was envious at the arrogant, seeing the prosperity of the wicked. <a id="c73_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For they have no pangs in their death, and their body is well nourished; <a id="c73_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They have not the hardships of mankind, neither are they plagued like other men: <a id="c73_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Therefore pride encompasseth them as a neck-chain, violence covereth them as a garment; <a id="c73_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Their eyes stand out from fatness, they exceed the imaginations of their heart: <a id="c73_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> They mock and speak wickedly of oppression, they speak loftily: <a id="c73_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> They set their mouth in the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. <a id="c73_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Therefore his people turn hither, and waters in fulness are wrung out to them. <a id="c73_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And they say, How can ·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> know, and is there knowledge in the Most High? <a id="c73_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Behold, these are the wicked, and they prosper in the world: they heap up riches. <a id="c73_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Truly have I purified my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency: <a id="c73_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For all the day have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</p>

<p><a id="c73_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> If I said, I will speak thus, behold, I should be faithless to the generation of thy children. <a id="c73_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> When I thought to be able to know this, it was a grievous task in mine eyes; <a id="c73_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Until I went into the sanctuaries of ·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> then understood I their end. <a id="c73_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Truly thou settest them in slippery places, thou castest them down in ruins. <a id="c73_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> How are they suddenly made desolate! they pass away, consumed with terrors. <a id="c73_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> As a dream, when one awaketh, wilt thou, Lord, on arising despise their image.</p>

<p><a id="c73_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> When my heart was in a ferment, and I was pricked in my reins, <a id="c73_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Then I was brutish and knew nothing; I was as a beast with thee. <a id="c73_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden my right hand; <a id="c73_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Thou wilt guide me by thy counsel, and after the glory, thou wilt receive me. <a id="c73_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Whom have I in the heavens? and there is none upon earth I desire beside thee. <a id="c73_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> My flesh and my heart faileth: God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever. <a id="c73_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> For behold, they that are far from thee shall perish; thou destroyest every one that goeth a whoring from thee. <a id="c73_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> But as for me, it is good for me to draw near to God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> I have put my trust in the Lord Jehovah, that I may declare all thy works.</p>
