<h2>Isaiah 52</h2>

<p><a id="c52_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. <a id="c52_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, captive daughter of Zion. <a id="c52_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For thus saith Jehovah: Ye have sold yourselves for nought, and ye shall be redeemed without money. <a id="c52_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there, and Assyria oppressed them without cause; <a id="c52_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and now, what have I here, saith Jehovah, that my people hath been taken away for nought? They that rule over them make them to howl, saith Jehovah; and continually all the day is my name scorned. <a id="c52_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Therefore my people shall know my name; therefore they shall know in that day that I am HE, that saith, Here am I.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that announceth glad tidings, that publisheth peace; that announceth glad tidings of good, that publisheth salvation, that saith unto Zion, Thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> reigneth! <a id="c52_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> --The voice of thy watchmen, they lift up the voice, they sing aloud together; for they shall see eye to eye, when Jehovah shall bring again Zion. <a id="c52_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Break forth, sing aloud together, waste places of Jerusalem; for Jehovah comforteth his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem. <a id="c52_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Jehovah hath made bare his holy arm in the sight of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a>  <a id="c52_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> --Depart, depart, go out from thence, touch not what is unclean; go out of the midst of her, be ye clean, that bear the vessels of Jehovah. <a id="c52_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight; for Jehovah will go before you, and the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> of Israel will be your rear-guard.</p>

<p><a id="c52_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Behold, my servant shall deal prudently; he shall be exalted and be lifted up, and be very high. <a id="c52_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> As many were astonished at thee--his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the children of men <a id="c52_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> --so shall he astonish many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for what had not been told them shall they see, and what they had not heard shall they consider.</p>
