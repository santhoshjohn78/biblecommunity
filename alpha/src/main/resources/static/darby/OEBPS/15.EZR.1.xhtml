<h2>Ezra 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he made a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also in writing, saying, <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth has Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of the heavens given to me, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Whosoever there is among you of all his people, his God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> of Israel -- he is God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> -- which is at Jerusalem. <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And whosoever remains in any place where he sojourns, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the voluntary offering for the house of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> which is at Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the chief fathers of Judah and Benjamin rose up, and the priests, and the Levites, even all those whose spirit God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> had stirred, to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is at Jerusalem. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with articles of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered. <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And king Cyrus brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem and had put in the house of his god. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Cyrus king of Persia brought them forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah. <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine-and-twenty knives, <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand four hundred. The whole did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.</p>
