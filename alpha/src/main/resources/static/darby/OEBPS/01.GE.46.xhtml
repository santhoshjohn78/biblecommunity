<h2>Genesis 46</h2>

<p><a id="c46_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba; and he offered sacrifices to the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of his father Isaac. <a id="c46_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> spoke to Israel in the visions of the night and said, Jacob, Jacob! And he said, Here am I. <a id="c46_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he said, I am Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> of thy father: fear not to go down to Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation. <a id="c46_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I will go down with thee to Egypt, and I will also certainly bring thee up; and Joseph shall put his hand on thine eyes.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, on the waggons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him. <a id="c46_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And they took their cattle, and their goods which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, Jacob and all his seed with him; <a id="c46_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> his sons and his sons' sons with him, his daughters and his sons' daughters and all his seed he brought with him to Egypt. <a id="c46_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And these are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt: Jacob and his sons. Jacob's firstborn, Reuben. <a id="c46_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the sons of Reuben: Enoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. <a id="c46_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> --And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Saul the son of a Canaanitish woman. <a id="c46_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> --And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. <a id="c46_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> --And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pherez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pherez were Hezron and Hamul. <a id="c46_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> --And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puah, and Job, and Shimron. <a id="c46_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> --And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. <a id="c46_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> --These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Padan-Aram; and his daughter, Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three. <a id="c46_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. <a id="c46_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> --And the sons of Asher: Jimnah, and Jishvah, and Jishvi, and Beriah; and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. <a id="c46_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> --These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and she bore these to Jacob: sixteen souls. <a id="c46_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin. <a id="c46_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asnath bore to him, the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On. <a id="c46_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> --And the sons of Benjamin: Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. <a id="c46_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> --These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. <a id="c46_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And the sons of Dan: Hushim. <a id="c46_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> --And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. <a id="c46_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> --These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter; and she bore these to Jacob: all the souls were seven. <a id="c46_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> All the souls that came with Jacob to Egypt, that had come out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives: all the souls were sixty-six. <a id="c46_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob that came to Egypt were seventy.</p>

<p><a id="c46_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to give notice before he came to Goshen. And they came into the land of Goshen. <a id="c46_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Then Joseph yoked his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and he presented himself to him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. <a id="c46_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, after I have seen thy face, since thou still livest. <a id="c46_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And Joseph said to his brethren and to his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and say to him, My brethren and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come to me; <a id="c46_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> and the men are shepherds, for they have been occupied with cattle; and they have brought their sheep, and their cattle, and all that they have. <a id="c46_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And it shall come to pass that when Pharaoh shall call you and say, What is your occupation? <a id="c46_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> then ye shall say, Thy servants are men that have been occupied with cattle from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers; in order that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.</p>
