<h2>Leviticus 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through inadvertence against any of the commandments of Jehovah in things that ought not to be done, and do any of them; <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> if the priest that is anointed sin according to the trespass of the people; then for his sin which he hath sinned shall he present a young bullock without blemish to Jehovah for a sin-offering. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he shall bring the bullock to the entrance of the tent of meeting before Jehovah; and shall lay his hand on the bullock's head, and slaughter the bullock before Jehovah. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it into the tent of meeting; <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Jehovah before the veil of the sanctuary; <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and the priest shall put of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense, which is in the tent of meeting, before Jehovah; and he shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering shall he take off from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is on the inwards, <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the net above the liver which he shall take away as far as the kidneys, <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offering; and the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt-offering. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung, <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> even the whole bullock shall he carry forth outside the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And if the whole assembly of Israel sin inadvertently, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the congregation, and they do somewhat against any of all the commandments of Jehovah in things which should not be done, and are guilty; <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and the sin wherewith they have sinned against it have become known; then the congregation shall present a young bullock for the sin-offering, and shall bring it before the tent of meeting; <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and the elders of the assembly shall lay their hands on the head of the bullock before Jehovah; and one shall slaughter the bullock before Jehovah. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood into the tent of meeting; <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before Jehovah, before the veil; <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and he shall put of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before Jehovah which is in the tent of meeting; and he shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting. <a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And all its fat shall he take off from it and burn on the altar. <a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock of sin-offering: so shall he do with it. And the priest shall make atonement for them; and it shall be forgiven them. <a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And he shall carry forth the bullock outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin-offering of the congregation.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> When a prince sinneth and through inadvertence doeth somewhat against any of all the commandments of Jehovah his God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> in things which should not be done, and is guilty; <a id="c4_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge, he shall bring his offering, a buck of the goats, a male without blemish. <a id="c4_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and slaughter it at the place where they slaughter the burnt-offering before Jehovah: it is a sin-offering. <a id="c4_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and shall pour out its blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt-offering. <a id="c4_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And he shall burn all its fat on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him to cleanse him from his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And if any one of the people of the land sin through inadvertence, that he do somewhat against any of the commandments of Jehovah in things which should not be done, and be guilty; <a id="c4_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge, then he shall bring his offering, a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned. <a id="c4_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and slaughter the sin-offering at the place of the burnt-offering. <a id="c4_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar. <a id="c4_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offering; and the priest shall burn it on the altar, for a sweet odour to Jehovah; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him. <a id="c4_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And if he bring a sheep for his offering for sin, a female without blemish shall he bring it. <a id="c4_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and slaughter it for a sin-offering at the place where they slaughter the burnt-offering. <a id="c4_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar. <a id="c4_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offering; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, with Jehovah's offerings by fire; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
