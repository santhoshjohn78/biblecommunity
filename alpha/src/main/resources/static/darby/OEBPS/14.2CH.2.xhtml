<h2>2 Chronicles 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom. <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Solomon numbered seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand stone-masons in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred to superintend them. <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Solomon sent to Huram king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein so do for me. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Behold, I build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> to dedicate it to him, to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual arrangement of the shewbread, and for the morning and evening burnt-offerings and on the sabbaths and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> This is an ordinance for ever to Israel. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the house that I will build is great; for great is our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> above all gods. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> But who is able to build him a house, seeing the heavens and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? And who am I that I should build him a house, except to burn sacrifice before him? <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And now send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple and crimson and blue, and experienced in carving, besides the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Send me also cedar-trees, cypress-trees, and sandal-wood trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants are experienced in cutting timber in Lebanon; and behold, my servants shall be with thy servants, <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house that I build shall be great and wonderful. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And behold, I will give to thy servants the hewers that fell timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Huram king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loved his people, he made thee king over them. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Huram said, Blessed be Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> of Israel, that made the heavens and the earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, who will build a house for Jehovah and a house for his kingdom. <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And now, I send a skilful man, endued with understanding, Huram Abi, <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and whose father was a man of Tyre, experienced in working in gold, and in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in byssus, and in crimson, and for doing any manner of engraving, and for inventing every device which shall be put to him, besides thy skilful men, and the skilful men of my lord David thy father. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And now the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants. <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa, and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem. <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the account that David his father had taken of them, and there were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred. <a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And he set seventy thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand to be stone-masons in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people to work.</p>
