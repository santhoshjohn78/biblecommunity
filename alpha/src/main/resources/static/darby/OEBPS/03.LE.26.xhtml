<h2>Leviticus 26</h2>

<p><a id="c26_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Ye shall make yourselves no idols, neither rear you up for yourselves carved image, or statue, nor shall ye set up a figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it; for I am Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a>  <a id="c26_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Ye shall observe my sabbaths, and my sanctuary shall ye reverence: I am Jehovah. <a id="c26_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If ye walk in my statutes, and observe my commandments and do them, <a id="c26_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> then I will give your rain in the season thereof, and the land shall yield its produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit; <a id="c26_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing-time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land securely. <a id="c26_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; and I will put away the evil beasts out of the land; and the sword shall not go through your land. <a id="c26_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword; <a id="c26_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight; and your enemies shall fall beside you by the sword. <a id="c26_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And I will turn my face towards you and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you. <a id="c26_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And ye shall eat old store, and clear away the old because of the new. <a id="c26_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And I will set my habitation among you; and my soul shall not abhor you; <a id="c26_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and I will walk among you, and will be your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> and ye shall be to me a people. <a id="c26_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I am Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you walk upright.</p>

<p><a id="c26_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But if ye hearken not unto me, and do not all these commandments, <a id="c26_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and if ye shall despise my statutes, and if your soul shall abhor mine ordinances, so that ye do not all my commandments, that ye break my covenant, <a id="c26_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> I also will do this unto you--I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and fever, which shall cause the eyes to fail, and the soul to waste away; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. <a id="c26_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And I will set my face against you, that ye may be routed before your enemies; they that hate you shall have dominion over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. <a id="c26_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And if for this ye hearken not unto me, I will punish you sevenfold more for your sins, <a id="c26_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and I will break the arrogance of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as bronze, <a id="c26_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and your strength shall be spent in vain, and your land shall not yield its produce; and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit. <a id="c26_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring sevenfold more plagues upon you according to your sins. <a id="c26_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And I will send the beasts of the field among you, that they may rob you of your children, and cut off your cattle, and make you few in number; and your streets shall be desolate. <a id="c26_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And if ye will not be disciplined by me through these, but walk contrary unto me, <a id="c26_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will smite you, even I, sevenfold for your sins. <a id="c26_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And I will bring a sword upon you that avengeth with the vengeance of the covenant, and ye shall be gathered together into your cities, and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. <a id="c26_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> When I break the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and shall deliver you the bread again by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. <a id="c26_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And if for this ye hearken not to me, but walk contrary unto me, <a id="c26_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven-fold for your sins. <a id="c26_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. <a id="c26_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And I will lay waste your high places, and cut down your sun-pillars, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you. <a id="c26_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And I will lay waste your cities and desolate your sanctuaries; and I will not smell your sweet odours. <a id="c26_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And I will bring the land into desolation; that your enemies who dwell there in may be astonished at it. <a id="c26_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And I will scatter you among the nations, and will draw out the sword after you; and your land shall be desolation, and your cities waste. <a id="c26_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the desolation, when ye are in your enemies' land; then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths. <a id="c26_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> All the days of the desolation it shall rest, the days in which it did not rest on your sabbaths, when ye dwelt therein. <a id="c26_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And as to those that remain of you--I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies, that the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth; <a id="c26_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> and they shall stumble one over another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth; and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. <a id="c26_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. <a id="c26_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And they that remain of you shall waste away through their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also through the iniquities of their fathers shall they waste away with them.</p>

<p><a id="c26_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, through their unfaithfulness wherein they were unfaithful to me, and also that they have walked contrary unto me, <a id="c26_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> so that I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies. If then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity, <a id="c26_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. <a id="c26_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> For the land shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, when it is in desolation without them; and they shall accept the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they despised my judgments, and their soul abhorred my statutes. <a id="c26_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not despise them, and will not abhor them, to make an end of them utterly, to break my covenant with them, for I am Jehovah their God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a>  <a id="c26_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> But I will remember toward them the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations, that I might be their God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> I am Jehovah. <a id="c26_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.</p>
