<h2>Psalms 64</h2>

<p><a id="c64_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Hear, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> my voice in my plaint; preserve my life from fear of the enemy: <a id="c64_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers, from the tumultuous crowd of the workers of iniquity, <a id="c64_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Who have sharpened their tongue like a sword, and have aimed their arrow, a bitter word; <a id="c64_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. <a id="c64_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They encourage themselves in an evil matter, they concert to hide snares; they say, Who will see them? <a id="c64_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> They devise iniquities: We have it ready, the plan is diligently sought out. And each one's inward thought and heart is deep.</p>

<p><a id="c64_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> will shoot an arrow at them: suddenly are they wounded; <a id="c64_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> By their own tongue they are made to fall over one another: all that see them shall flee away. <a id="c64_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And all men shall fear, and shall declare God's<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> doing; and they shall wisely consider his work. <a id="c64_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The righteous shall rejoice in Jehovah, and trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.</p>
