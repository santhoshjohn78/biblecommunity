<h2>2 Timothy 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> But this know, that in the last days difficult times shall be there; <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> for men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, evil speakers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, profane, <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, of unsubdued passions, savage, having no love for what is good, <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> traitors, headlong, of vain pretensions, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> having a form of piety but denying the power of it: and from these turn away. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For of these are they who are getting into houses, and leading captive silly women, laden with sins, led by various lusts, <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Now in the same manner in which Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, thus these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, found worthless as regards the faith. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But they shall not advance farther; for their folly shall be completely manifest to all, as that of those also became.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> But thou hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance, <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> persecutions, sufferings: what sufferings happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured; and the Lord delivered me out of all. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And all indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But wicked men and juggling impostors shall advance in evil, leading and being led astray. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But thou, abide in those things which thou hast learned, and of which thou hast been fully persuaded, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and that from a child thou hast known the sacred letters, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work.</p>
