<h2>Isaiah 31</h2>

<p><a id="c31_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and depend on horses, and confide in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong; and who look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah! <a id="c31_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> But he also is wise, and he bringeth evil, and recalleth not his words; and he will arise against the house of evildoers, and against the help of workers of iniquity. <a id="c31_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the Egyptians are men, and not Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> and their horses flesh, and not spirit; and Jehovah shall stretch forth his hand, and he that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is helped shall fall, and they all shall perish together. <a id="c31_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For thus hath Jehovah said unto me: Like as the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, is not afraid of their voice, nor giveth way before the multitude of them; so will Jehovah of hosts come down to war upon mount Zion, and on the hill thereof. <a id="c31_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> As birds with outstretched wings, so will Jehovah of hosts cover Jerusalem; covering, he will also deliver, passing over, he will rescue it.</p>

<p><a id="c31_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Turn unto him from whom ye have deeply revolted, ye children of Israel; <a id="c31_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your sinful hands have made unto you. <a id="c31_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Asshur shall fall by the sword, not of a great man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become tributary; <a id="c31_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and for fear, he shall pass over to his rock, and his princes shall be afraid of the banner, saith Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.</p>
