<h2>Psalms 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, and standeth not in the way of sinners, and sitteth not in the seat of scorners; <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> But his delight is in Jehovah's law, and in his law doth he meditate day and night. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he is as a tree planted by brooks of water, which giveth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf fadeth not; and all that he doeth prospereth.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The wicked are not so; but are as the chaff which the wind driveth away. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.</p>
