<h2>Psalms 93</h2>

<p><a id="c93_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah reigneth, he hath clothed himself with majesty: Jehovah hath clothed himself, he hath girded himself with strength; yea, the world is established, it shall not be moved. <a id="c93_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thy throne is established of old; thou art from eternity. <a id="c93_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The floods lifted up, O Jehovah, the floods lifted up their voice; the floods lifted up their roaring waves. <a id="c93_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Jehovah on high is mightier than the voices of many waters, than the mighty breakers of the sea. <a id="c93_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for ever.</p>
