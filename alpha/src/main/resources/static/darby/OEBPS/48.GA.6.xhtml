<h2>Galatians 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Brethren, if even a man be taken in some fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest thou also be tempted. <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfil the law of the Christ. <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For if any man reputes himself to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself; <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> but let each prove his own work, and then he will have his boast in what belongs to himself alone, and not in what belongs to another. <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For each shall bear his own burden. <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things. <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Be not deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man shall sow, that also shall he reap. <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For he that sows to his own flesh, shall reap corruption from the flesh; but he that sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit shall reap eternal life: <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> but let us not lose heart in doing good; for in due time, if we do not faint, we shall reap. <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> So then, as we have occasion, let us do good towards all, and specially towards those of the household of faith.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> See how long a letter I have written to you with my own hand. <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> As many as desire to have a fair appearance in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not be persecuted because of the cross of Christ. <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For neither do they that are circumcised themselves keep the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh. <a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> But far be it from me to boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world. <a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision; but new creation. <a id="c6_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace upon them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. <a id="c6_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For the rest let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus. <a id="c6_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</p>
