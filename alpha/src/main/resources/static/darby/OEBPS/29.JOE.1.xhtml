<h2>Joel 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers? <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Tell your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation: <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> that which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine: for it is cut off from your mouth. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For a nation is come up upon my land, strong and without number: his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a lioness. <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He hath made my vine a desolation, and barked my fig-tree; he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away: its branches are made white.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Wail like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The oblation and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, Jehovah's ministers, mourn. <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The field is laid waste, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Be ashamed, ye husbandmen; howl, ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley: because the harvest of the field hath perished. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The vine is dried up, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm also and the apple-tree; all the trees of the field are withered, yea, joy is withered away from the children of men. <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests; howl, ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> for the oblation and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a></p>

<p><a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Hallow a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly, gather the elders, and all the inhabitants of the land to the house of Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> and cry unto Jehovah. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Alas for the day! for the day of Jehovah is at hand, and as destruction from the Almighty shall it come. <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Is not the food cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a>  <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The seeds are rotten under their clods, the granaries are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered. <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> How do the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are bewildered, for they have no pasture; the flocks of sheep also are in suffering. <a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> To thee, Jehovah, do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned up all the trees of the field. <a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> The beasts of the field also cry unto thee; for the water-courses are dried, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</p>
