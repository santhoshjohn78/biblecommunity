<h2>Psalms 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In Jehovah have I put my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain? <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For behold, the wicked bend the bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may in darkness shoot at the upright in heart. <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> If the foundations be destroyed, what shall the righteous do?</p>

<p><a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Jehovah is in the temple of his holiness; Jehovah, --his throne is in the heavens: his eyes behold, his eyelids try the children of men. <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Jehovah trieth the righteous one; but the wicked, and him that loveth violence, his soul hateth. <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone; and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup. <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For righteous is Jehovah; he loveth righteousness, his countenance doth behold the upright.</p>
