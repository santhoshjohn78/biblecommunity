<h2>Psalms 147</h2>

<p><a id="c147_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise ye Jah! for it is good. Sing psalms of our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> for it is pleasant: praise is comely. <a id="c147_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth the outcasts of Israel. <a id="c147_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. <a id="c147_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He counteth the number of the stars; he giveth names to them all. <a id="c147_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite. <a id="c147_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Jehovah lifteth up the meek; he abaseth the wicked to the earth. <a id="c147_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Sing unto Jehovah with thanksgiving; sing psalms upon the harp unto our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a>  <a id="c147_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Who covereth the heavens with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains; <a id="c147_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Who giveth to the cattle their food, to the young ravens which cry. <a id="c147_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> He delighteth not in the strength of the horse, he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man; <a id="c147_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Jehovah taketh pleasure in those that fear him, in those that hope in his loving-kindness.</p>

<p><a id="c147_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Laud Jehovah, O Jerusalem; praise thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> O Zion. <a id="c147_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee; <a id="c147_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> He maketh peace in thy borders; he satisfieth thee with the finest of the wheat. <a id="c147_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> He sendeth forth his oracles to the earth: his word runneth very swiftly. <a id="c147_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> He giveth snow like wool, scattereth the hoar frost like ashes; <a id="c147_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold? <a id="c147_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> He sendeth his word, and melteth them; he causeth his wind to blow--the waters flow. <a id="c147_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. <a id="c147_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> He hath not dealt thus with any nation; and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Hallelujah!</p>
