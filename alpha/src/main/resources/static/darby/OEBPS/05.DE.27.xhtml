<h2>Deuteronomy 27</h2>

<p><a id="c27_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandment which I command you this day. <a id="c27_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And it shall be on the day when ye pass over the Jordan unto the land which Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaster them with plaster: <a id="c27_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou goest over that thou mayest enter into the land which Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> giveth thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, as Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> of thy fathers hath promised thee. <a id="c27_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And it shall be when ye go over the Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, as I command you this day, on mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster. <a id="c27_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And there shalt thou build an altar to Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> an altar of stones; thou shalt not lift up an iron tool upon them; <a id="c27_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> of whole stones shalt thou build the altar of Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> and thou shalt offer up burnt-offerings thereon to Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a>  <a id="c27_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And thou shalt sacrifice peace-offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a>  <a id="c27_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly. <a id="c27_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Moses and the priests, the Levites, spoke to all Israel, saying, Be silent and hearken, Israel! this day thou art become the people of Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a>  <a id="c27_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And thou shalt hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a> and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.</p>

<p><a id="c27_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Moses gave commandment to the people the same day, saying, <a id="c27_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> These shall stand to bless the people upon mount Gerizim, when ye have gone over the Jordan: Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin. <a id="c27_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. <a id="c27_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the Levites shall declare and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice: <a id="c27_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image, an abomination to Jehovah, a work of the craftsman's hand, and putteth it up secretly! And all the people shall answer and say, Amen. <a id="c27_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Cursed be he that slighteth his father or his mother! And all the people shall say, Amen. <a id="c27_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark! And all the people shall say, Amen. <a id="c27_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way! And all the people shall say, Amen. <a id="c27_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow! And all the people shall say, Amen. <a id="c27_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; for he uncovereth his father's skirt! And all the people shall say, Amen. <a id="c27_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast! And all the people shall say, Amen. <a id="c27_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother! And all the people shall say, Amen. <a id="c27_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Cursed be he that lieth with his mother-in-law! And all the people shall say, Amen. <a id="c27_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly! And all the people shall say, Amen. <a id="c27_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Cursed be he that taketh reward to smite mortally shedding innocent blood! And all the people shall say, Amen. <a id="c27_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Cursed be he that confirmeth not the words of this law to do them! And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
