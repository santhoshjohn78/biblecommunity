<h2>Judges 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah. <a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred silver-pieces that were taken from thee, and about which thou didst curse and speak of in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son of Jehovah! <a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he restored the eleven hundred silver-pieces to his mother; and his mother said, I had dedicated the silver to Jehovah from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image; and now I will restore it to thee. <a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Now he restored the silver to his mother; and his mother took two hundred silver-pieces and gave them to the founder, and he made of them a graven image and a molten image; and they were in the house of Micah. <a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. <a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And there was a young man out of Bethlehem-Judah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. <a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the man departed from the city, from Bethlehem-Judah, to sojourn where he might find a place. And as he journeyed, he came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah. <a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Micah said to him, Whence comest thou? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Bethlehem-Judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place. <a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give thee yearly ten silver-pieces, and a suit of garments, and thy victuals. And the Levite went in. <a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons. <a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. <a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Then said Micah, Now I know that Jehovah will do me good, because I have the Levite for priest.</p>
