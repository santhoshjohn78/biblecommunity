<h2>Revelation 13</h2>

<p><a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I stood upon the sand of the sea; and I saw a beast rising out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and upon its horns ten diadems, and upon its heads names of blasphemy. <a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And the beast which I saw was like to a leopardess, and its feet as of a bear, and its mouth as a lion's mouth; and the dragon gave to it his power, and his throne, and great authority; <a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and one of his heads was as slain to death, and his wound of death had been healed: and the whole earth wondered after the beast. <a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And they did homage to the dragon, because he gave the authority to the beast; and they did homage to the beast, saying, Who is like to the beast? and who can make war with it? <a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And there was given to it a mouth, speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given to it authority to pursue its career forty-two months. <a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And it opened its mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle, and those who have their tabernacle in the heaven. <a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And there was given to it to make war with the saints, and to overcome them; and there was given to it authority over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation; <a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and all that dwell on the earth shall do it homage, every one whose name had not been written from the founding of the world in the book of life of the slain Lamb. <a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> If any one has an ear, let him hear. <a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> If any one leads into captivity, he goes into captivity. If any one shall kill with the sword, he must with the sword be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And I saw another beast rising out of the earth; and it had two horns like to a lamb, and spake as a dragon; <a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and it exercises all the authority of the first beast before it, and causes the earth and those that dwell in it to do homage to the first beast, whose wound of death was healed. <a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And it works great signs, that it should cause even fire to come down from heaven to the earth before men. <a id="c13_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And it deceives those that dwell upon the earth by reason of the signs which it was given to it to work before the beast, saying to those that dwell upon the earth to make an image to the beast, which has the wound of the sword, and lived. <a id="c13_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And it was given to it to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should also speak, and should cause that as many as should not do homage to the image of the beast should be killed. <a id="c13_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And it causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bondmen, that they should give them a mark upon their right hand or upon their forehead; <a id="c13_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and that no one should be able to buy or sell save he that had the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of its name. <a id="c13_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Here is wisdom. He that has understanding let him count the number of the beast: for it is a man's number; and its number is six hundred and sixty-six.</p>
