<h2>Psalms 149</h2>

<p><a id="c149_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Hallelujah! Sing unto Jehovah a new song; sing his praise in the congregation of the godly. <a id="c149_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; let the sons of Zion be joyful in their King. <a id="c149_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Let them praise his name in the dance; let them sing psalms unto him with the tambour and harp. <a id="c149_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people; he beautifieth the meek with salvation. <a id="c149_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Let the godly exult in glory; let them shout for joy upon their beds.</p>

<p><a id="c149_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Let the high praises of Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand: <a id="c149_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> To execute vengeance against the nations, and punishment among the peoples; <a id="c149_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; <a id="c149_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> To execute upon them the judgment written. This honour have all his saints. Hallelujah!</p>
