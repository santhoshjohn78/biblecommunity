<h2>Hosea 9</h2>

<p><a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Rejoice not, Israel, exultingly, as the peoples; for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> thou hast loved harlot's hire upon every corn-floor. <a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her. <a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> They shall not dwell in Jehovah's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and in Assyria shall they eat that which is unclean. <a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> They shall pour out no offerings of wine to Jehovah, neither shall their sacrifices be pleasing unto him: they shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be defiled: for their bread shall be for themselves; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah. <a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> What will ye do in the day of assembly, and in the day of the feast of Jehovah? <a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For behold, they are gone away because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Moph shall bury them: their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The days of visitation are come; the days of recompence are come: Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the inspired man is mad, because of the greatness of thine iniquity, and the great enmity. <a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Is Ephraim a watchman with my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> nay the prophet is a fowler's snare on all his ways, enmity in the house of his God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a>  <a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins. <a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I found Israel as grapes in the wilderness; as first-ripe fruit on the fig-tree, I saw your fathers at the beginning: they went to Baal-Peor, and separated themselves unto that shame, and became abominations like their lover.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away as a bird, --no birth, no pregnancy, no conception! <a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For even should they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that not a man remain: for woe also to them when I shall have departed from them! <a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Ephraim, as I saw him, was a Tyre planted in a beautiful place; but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the slayer. <a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Give them, Jehovah--what wilt thou give? --give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. <a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings, I will drive them out of my house, I will love them no more: all their princes are rebellious. <a id="c9_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Ephraim is smitten: their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit; yea, though they should bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb. <a id="c9_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> My God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> hath rejected them, because they hearkened not unto him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</p>
