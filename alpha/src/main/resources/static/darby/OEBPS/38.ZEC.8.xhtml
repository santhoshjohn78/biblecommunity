<h2>Zechariah 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me, saying, <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great fury. <a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thus saith Jehovah: I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem shall be called, The city of truth; and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, The holy mountain. <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each one with his staff in his hand for multitude of days. <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If it be wonderful in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be wonderful in mine eyes? saith Jehovah of hosts. <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the west country; <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> in truth and in righteousness.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, that were in the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built. <a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; and there was no peace for him that went out or that came in, because of the distress: for I let loose all men, every one against his neighbour. <a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days, saith Jehovah of hosts; <a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> for the seed shall be prosperous, the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its produce, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things. <a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And it shall come to pass, like as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear ye not, let your hands be strong. <a id="c8_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Like as I thought to do you evil when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I repented not; <a id="c8_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> so again have I thought in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not. <a id="c8_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> These are the things that ye shall do: Speak truth every one with his neighbour; execute truth and the judgment of peace in your gates; <a id="c8_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me, saying, <a id="c8_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful gatherings. Love ye then truth and peace. <a id="c8_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet again shall there come peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities; <a id="c8_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to supplicate Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of hosts: I will go also. <a id="c8_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, and to supplicate Jehovah. <a id="c8_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days shall ten men take hold, out of all languages of the nations, shall even take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you; for we have heard that God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> is with you.</p>
