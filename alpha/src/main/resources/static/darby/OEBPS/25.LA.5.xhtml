<h2>Lamentations 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us; consider, and see our reproach. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows. <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Our water have we to drink for money, our wood cometh unto us for a price. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Our pursuers are on our necks: we are weary, we have no rest. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> We have given the hand to Egypt, and to Asshur, to be satisfied with bread. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Our fathers have sinned, and they are not; and we bear their iniquities. <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Bondmen rule over us: there is no deliverer out of their hand. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> We have to get our bread at the risk of our lives, because of the sword of the wilderness. <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Our skin gloweth like an oven, because of the burning heat of the famine. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> They have ravished the women in Zion, the maids in the cities of Judah. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Princes were hanged up by their hand; the faces of elders were not honoured. <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The young men have borne the mill, and the youths have stumbled under the wood. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music. <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The joy of our heart hath ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, for we have sinned!</p>

<p><a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes have grown dim, <a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate: foxes walk over it. <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Thou, Jehovah, dwellest for ever; thy throne is from generation to generation. <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, dost thou forsake us so long time? <a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Turn thou us unto thee, Jehovah, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. <a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Or is it that thou hast utterly rejected us? Wouldest thou be exceeding wroth against us?</p>
