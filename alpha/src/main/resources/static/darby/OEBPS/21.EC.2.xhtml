<h2>Ecclesiastes 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I said in my heart, Come now, I will try thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure. But behold, this also is vanity. <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I said of laughter, Madness! and of mirth, What availeth it? <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I searched in my heart how to cherish my flesh with wine, while practising my heart with wisdom; and how to lay hold on folly, till I should see what was that good for the children of men which they should do under the heavens all the days of their life. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards; <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of every kind of fruit; <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I made me ponds of water, to water therewith the wood, where the trees are reared. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I acquired servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that had been in Jerusalem before me. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces; I got me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the children of men, a wife and concubines. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And I became great, and increased more than all that had been before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them: I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour, and this was my portion from all my labour. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that it had cost me to do them; and behold, all was vanity and pursuit of the wind, and there was no profit under the sun.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly; for what shall the man do that cometh after the king? --that which hath already been done. <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as light excelleth darkness. <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness; but I myself also perceived that one event happeneth to them all. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And I said in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool so will it happen even to me; and why was I then so wise? Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity. <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> For there shall be no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; because everything is already forgotten in the days which come. And how dieth the wise even as the fool?</p>

<p><a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And I hated life; for the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and pursuit of the wind. <a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And I hated all my labour wherewith I had been toiling under the sun, because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me. <a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour at which I have laboured, and wherein I have been wise under the sun. This also is vanity. <a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Then I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour wherewith I had laboured under the sun. <a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For there is a man whose labour hath been with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skill, and who leaveth it to a man that hath not laboured therein, to be his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. <a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For what will man have of all his labour and of the striving of his heart, wherewith he hath wearied himself under the sun? <a id="c2_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> For all his days are sorrows, and his travail vexation: even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity. <a id="c2_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> There is nothing good for man, but that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a>  <a id="c2_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> For who can eat, or who be eager, more than I? <a id="c2_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For he giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good in God's<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> sight. This also is vanity and pursuit of the wind.</p>
