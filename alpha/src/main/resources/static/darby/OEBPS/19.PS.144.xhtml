<h2>Psalms 144</h2>

<p><a id="c144_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Blessed be Jehovah my rock, who teacheth my hands to war, my fingers to fight; <a id="c144_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> My mercy and my fortress, my high tower and my deliverer, my shield and he in whom I trust, who subdueth my people under me! <a id="c144_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Jehovah, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him, the son of man, that thou takest thought of him? <a id="c144_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Man is like to vanity; his days are as a shadow that passeth away. <a id="c144_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Jehovah, bow thy heavens, and come down; touch the mountains, that they smoke; <a id="c144_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Cast forth lightnings, and scatter them; send forth thine arrows, and discomfit them: <a id="c144_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Stretch out thy hands from above; rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of aliens, <a id="c144_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</p>

<p><a id="c144_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> I will sing a new song unto thee; with the ten-stringed lute will I sing psalms unto thee: <a id="c144_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Who givest salvation unto kings; who rescuest David thy servant from the hurtful sword. <a id="c144_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Rescue me, and deliver me from the hand of aliens, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood. <a id="c144_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; our daughters as corner-columns, sculptured after the fashion of a palace: <a id="c144_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Our granaries full, affording all manner of store; our sheep bringing forth thousands, ten thousands in our pastures; <a id="c144_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Our kine laden with young; no breaking in and no going forth, and no outcry in our streets. <a id="c144_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Blessed the people that is in such a case! Blessed the people whose God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> is Jehovah!</p>
