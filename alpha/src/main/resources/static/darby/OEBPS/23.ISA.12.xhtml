<h2>Isaiah 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And in that day thou shalt say, Jehovah, I will praise thee; for though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou hast comforted me. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Behold, Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> is my salvation: I will trust, and not be afraid; for Jah, Jehovah, is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And in that day shall ye say, Give ye thanks to Jehovah, call upon his name, declare his deeds among the peoples, make mention that his name is exalted. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Sing psalms of Jehovah, for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Cry out and shout, thou inhabitress of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.</p>
