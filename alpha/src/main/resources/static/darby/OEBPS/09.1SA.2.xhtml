<h2>1 Samuel 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart exulteth in Jehovah, my horn is lifted up in Jehovah; my mouth is opened wide over mine enemies; for I rejoice in thy salvation. <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> There is none holy as Jehovah, for there is none beside thee, neither is there any rock like our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a>  <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Do not multiply your words of pride, let not vain-glory come out of your mouth; For Jehovah is a Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The bow of the mighty is broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They that were full have hired themselves out for bread; and the hungry are so no more: Even the barren beareth seven, and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich, he bringeth low, also he lifteth up: <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy, To set him among nobles; and he maketh them inherit a throne of glory; For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, and he hath set the world upon them. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He keepeth the feet of his saints, but the wicked are silenced in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail. <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces; in the heavens will he thunder upon them. Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; and he will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the boy ministered to Jehovah in the presence of Eli the priest. <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not Jehovah. <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the priests' custom with the people was, when any man sacrificed a sacrifice, the priest's servant came, when the flesh was cooked, with a flesh-hook of three prongs in his hand; <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot; the priest took of it all that the flesh-hook brought up. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came there. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Even before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, and he will not accept sodden flesh of thee, but raw. <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> If the man said to him, They will immediately burn the fat entire, then take as thy soul desires; he would say to him, No, but thou shalt give it now; and if not, I will take it by force. <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah, for men despised the offering of Jehovah. <a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Samuel ministered before Jehovah, a boy girded with a linen ephod. <a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to sacrifice the yearly sacrifice. <a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to Jehovah. And they went to their own home. <a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> So Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew before Jehovah. <a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and that they lay with the women that served at the entrance of the tent of meeting. <a id="c2_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And he said to them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil deeds from all this people. <a id="c2_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> No, my sons, for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah's people transgress. <a id="c2_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> If one man sin against another, God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> will judge him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall intreat for him? But they hearkened not to the voice of their father, for Jehovah was minded to slay them. <a id="c2_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And the boy Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with Jehovah and also with men.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And there came a man of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> to Eli and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Did I plainly reveal myself to the house of thy father when they were in Egypt, in Pharaoh's house, <a id="c2_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> and choose him out of all the tribes of Israel, to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear the ephod before me? and I gave unto the house of thy father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel. <a id="c2_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Wherefore do ye trample upon my sacrifice and upon mine oblation which I have commanded in my habitation? And thou honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the primest of all the oblations of Israel my people. <a id="c2_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Wherefore Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> of Israel saith, I said indeed, Thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever. But now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. <a id="c2_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Behold, days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house. <a id="c2_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And thou shalt see an oppressor in my habitation, amidst all the good that shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever. <a id="c2_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And the man of thine whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to cause thine eyes to fail and to grieve thy soul; and all the increase of thy house shall die in their vigour. <a id="c2_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And this shall be the sign to thee, which shall come upon thy two sons, upon Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die, both of them. <a id="c2_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed continually. <a id="c2_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And it shall come to pass that every one that is left of thy house shall come to crouch to him for a small piece of silver and for a cake of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priestly offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</p>
