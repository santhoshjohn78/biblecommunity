<h2>Psalms 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy majesty above the heavens. <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established praise because of thine adversaries, to still the enemy and the avenger.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> When I see thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and stars, which thou hast established; <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and splendour. <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Thou hast made him to rule over the works of thy hands; thou hast put everything under his feet: <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Sheep and oxen, all of them, and also the beasts of the field; <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The fowl of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, whatever passeth through the paths of the seas. <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!</p>
