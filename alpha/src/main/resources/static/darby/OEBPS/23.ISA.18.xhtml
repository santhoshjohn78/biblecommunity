<h2>Isaiah 18</h2>

<p><a id="c18_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Ha! land shadowing with wings, which art beyond the rivers of Cush, <a id="c18_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> that sendest ambassadors over the sea, and in vessels of papyrus upon the waters, saying, Go, swift messengers, to a nation scattered and ravaged, to a people terrible from their existence and thenceforth; to a nation of continued waiting and of treading down, whose land the rivers have spoiled! <a id="c18_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, when a banner is lifted up on the mountains, see ye, and when a trumpet is blown, hear ye! <a id="c18_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For thus hath Jehovah said unto me: I will take my rest, and I will observe from my dwelling-place like clear heat upon herbs, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. <a id="c18_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For before the harvest, when the blossoming is over, and the flower becometh a ripening grape, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning-knives, and take away and cut down the branches. <a id="c18_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> They shall be left together unto the mountain birds of prey, and to the beasts of the earth; and the birds of prey shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them. <a id="c18_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> In that time shall a present be brought unto Jehovah of hosts of a people scattered and ravaged, --and from a people terrible from their existence and thenceforth, a nation of continued waiting and of treading down, whose land the rivers have spoiled, ...to the place of the name of Jehovah of hosts, the mount Zion.</p>
