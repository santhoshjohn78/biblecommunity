<h2>Psalms 87</h2>

<p><a id="c87_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> His foundation is in the mountains of holiness. <a id="c87_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more than all the habitations of Jacob. <a id="c87_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c87_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon among them that know me; behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: this man was born there. <a id="c87_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her; and the Most High himself shall establish her. <a id="c87_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Jehovah will count, when he inscribeth the peoples, This man was born there. Selah. <a id="c87_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> As well the singers as the dancers shall say, All my springs are in thee.</p>
