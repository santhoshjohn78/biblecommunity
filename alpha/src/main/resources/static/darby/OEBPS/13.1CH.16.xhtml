<h2>1 Chronicles 16</h2>

<p><a id="c16_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And they brought in the ark of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> and set it in the midst of the tent that David had spread for it; and they presented burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a>  <a id="c16_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And when David had ended offering up the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah. <a id="c16_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread and a measure of wine and a raisin-cake. <a id="c16_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he appointed certain of the Levites to do the service before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate, and to thank and praise Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> of Israel: <a id="c16_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with instruments of lutes and with harps; and Asaph sounding with cymbals; <a id="c16_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a></p>

<p><a id="c16_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to give thanks to Jehovah through Asaph and his brethren. <a id="c16_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known his acts among the peoples. <a id="c16_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him; Meditate upon all his wondrous works. <a id="c16_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Glory in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah. <a id="c16_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Seek Jehovah and his strength, Seek his face continually; <a id="c16_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Remember his wondrous works which he hath done; His miracles, and the judgments of his mouth: <a id="c16_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Ye seed of Israel his servant, Ye sons of Jacob, his chosen ones. <a id="c16_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> He, Jehovah, is our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> His judgments are in all the earth. <a id="c16_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Be ye ever mindful of his covenant, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations, -- <a id="c16_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Which he made with Abraham, And of his oath unto Isaac; <a id="c16_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And he confirmed it unto Jacob for a statute, Unto Israel for an everlasting covenant, <a id="c16_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance; <a id="c16_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> When ye were a few men in number, Of small account, and strangers in it. <a id="c16_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And they went from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people. <a id="c16_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> He suffered no man to oppress them, And reproved kings for their sakes, <a id="c16_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm. <a id="c16_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; Publish his salvation from day to day. <a id="c16_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Declare his glory among the nations, His wondrous works among all peoples. <a id="c16_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> For Jehovah is great, and exceedingly to be praised; And he is terrible above all gods. <a id="c16_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> For all the gods of the peoples are idols; But Jehovah made the heavens. <a id="c16_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Majesty and splendour are before him; Strength and gladness in his place. <a id="c16_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Give unto Jehovah, ye families of peoples, Give unto Jehovah glory and strength! <a id="c16_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Give unto Jehovah the glory of his name! Bring an oblation, and come before him: Worship Jehovah in holy splendour. <a id="c16_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Tremble before him, all the earth: The world also is established, it shall not be moved. <a id="c16_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth! <a id="c16_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein. <a id="c16_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Then shall the trees of the forest sing out at the presence of Jehovah, For he cometh to judge the earth. <a id="c16_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Give thanks unto Jehovah, for he is good; For his loving-kindness endureth for ever. <a id="c16_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And say, Save us, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> of our salvation, And gather us, and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, To triumph in thy praise. <a id="c16_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Blessed be Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> of Israel, from eternity and to eternity! And all the people said, Amen! and praised Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to do the service before the ark continually, as every day's duty required; <a id="c16_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> and Obed-Edom, and their brethren, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also, the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah as doorkeepers. <a id="c16_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon, <a id="c16_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> to offer up burnt-offerings to Jehovah on the altar of burnt-offering continually, morning and evening, and according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded Israel; <a id="c16_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, because his loving-kindness endureth for ever; <a id="c16_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> and with them, with Heman and Jeduthun, trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud; and the musical instruments of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> And the sons of Jeduthun were at the gate. <a id="c16_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> And all the people departed every one to his house; and David returned to bless his household.</p>
