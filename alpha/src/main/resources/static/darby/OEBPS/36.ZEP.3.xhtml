<h2>Zephaniah 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Woe to her that is rebellious and corrupted, to the oppressing city! <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> She hearkened not to the voice; she received not correction; she confided not in Jehovah; she drew not near her God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a>  <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves, that leave nothing for the morning. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Her prophets are vain-glorious, treacherous persons; her priests profane the sanctuary, they do violence to the law. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The righteous Jehovah is in the midst of her: he doeth no wrong. Every morning doth he bring his judgment to light; it faileth not: but the unrighteous knoweth no shame. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I have cut off nations: their battlements are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> I said, Only fear me, receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, howsoever I may punish her. But they rose early, they corrupted all their doings.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to assemble the nations, that I may gather the kingdoms together, to pour upon them mine indignation, --all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one consent. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> From beyond the rivers of Cush my suppliants, the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine oblation. <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that exult in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of Jehovah. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The remnant of Israel shall not work unrighteousness, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: but they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Exult, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; rejoice and be glad with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem: <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy; the King of Israel, Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not see evil any more. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear not; Zion, let not thy hands be slack. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> is in thy midst, a mighty one that will save: he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will exult over thee with singing. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assemblies, who were of thee: the reproach of it was a burden unto them. <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save her that halted, and gather her that was driven out; and I will make them a praise and a name in all the lands where they have been put to shame. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> At that time will I bring you, yea, at the time that I gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise, among all the peoples of the earth, when I shall turn again your captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah.</p>
