<h2>Revelation 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard as of a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will shew thee the things which must take place after these things. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Immediately I became in the Spirit; and behold, a throne stood in the heaven, and upon the throne one sitting, <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and he that was sitting like in appearance to a stone of jasper and a sardius, and a rainbow round the throne like in appearance to an emerald. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And round the throne twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones twenty-four elders sitting, clothed with white garments; and on their heads golden crowns. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And out of the throne go forth lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and seven lamps of fire, burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God; <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and before the throne, as a glass sea, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, four living creatures, full of eyes, before and behind; <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and the first living creature like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature having the face as of a man, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the four living creatures, each one of them having respectively six wings; round and within they are full of eyes; and they cease not day and night saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And when the living creatures shall give glory and honour and thanksgiving to him that sits upon the throne, who lives to the ages of ages, <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> the twenty-four elders shall fall before him that sits upon the throne, and do homage to him that lives to the ages of ages; and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying, <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Thou art worthy, O our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honour and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy will they were, and they have been created.</p>
