<h2>Song of Solomon 7</h2>

<p><a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> How beautiful are thy footsteps in sandals, O prince's daughter! The roundings of thy thighs are like jewels, The work of the hands of an artist. <a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thy navel is a round goblet, which wanteth not mixed wine; Thy belly a heap of wheat, set about with lilies; <a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thy two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle; <a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; Thine eyes, like the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose like the tower of Lebanon, Which looketh toward Damascus; <a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the locks of thy head like purple; The king is fettered by thy ringlets! <a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> How fair and how pleasant art thou, my love, in delights! <a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, And thy breasts to grape clusters. <a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I said, I will go up to the palm-tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof; And thy breasts shall indeed be like clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of thy nose like apples, <a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine, ...That goeth down smoothly for my beloved, And stealeth over the lips of them that are asleep.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I am my beloved's, And his desire is toward me. <a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> --Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields; Let us lodge in the villages. <a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> We will go up early to the vineyards, We will see if the vine hath budded, If the blossom is opening, And the pomegranates are in bloom: There will I give thee my loves. <a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The mandrakes yield fragrance; And at our gates are all choice fruits, new and old: I have laid them up for thee, my beloved.</p>
