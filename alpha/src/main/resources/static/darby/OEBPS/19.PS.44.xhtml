<h2>Psalms 44</h2>

<p><a id="c44_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> with our ears have we heard, our fathers have told us, the work thou wroughtest in their days, in the days of old: <a id="c44_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thou, by thy hand, didst dispossess the nations, but them thou didst plant; thou didst afflict the peoples, but them didst thou cause to spread out. <a id="c44_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For not by their own sword did they take possession of the land, neither did their own arm save them; but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst delight in them. <a id="c44_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thou thyself art my king, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> command deliverance for Jacob. <a id="c44_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Through thee will we push down our adversaries; through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. <a id="c44_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For I will not put confidence in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. <a id="c44_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For thou hast saved us from our adversaries, and hast put them to shame that hate us. <a id="c44_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> In God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> will we boast all the day, and we will praise thy name for ever. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c44_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But thou hast cast off, and put us to confusion, and dost not go forth with our armies; <a id="c44_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Thou hast made us to turn back from the adversary, and they that hate us spoil for themselves; <a id="c44_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Thou hast given us over like sheep appointed for meat, and hast scattered us among the nations; <a id="c44_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Thou hast sold thy people for nought, and hast not increased thy wealth by their price; <a id="c44_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a mockery and a derision for them that are round about us; <a id="c44_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Thou makest us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples. <a id="c44_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> All the day my confusion is before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me, <a id="c44_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Because of the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and the avenger.</p>

<p><a id="c44_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely against thy covenant: <a id="c44_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy path; <a id="c44_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Though thou hast crushed us in the place of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death. <a id="c44_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> If we had forgotten the name of our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> and stretched out our hands to a strange god<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a>  <a id="c44_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Would not God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. <a id="c44_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are reckoned as sheep for slaughter. <a id="c44_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Awake, why sleepest thou, Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever. <a id="c44_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression? <a id="c44_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly cleaveth unto the earth. <a id="c44_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Rise up for our help, and redeem us for thy loving-kindness' sake.</p>
