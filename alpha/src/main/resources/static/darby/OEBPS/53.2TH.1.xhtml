<h2>2 Thessalonians 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the assembly of Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> We ought to thank God always for you, brethren, even as it is meet, because your faith increases exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all towards one another abounds; <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> so that we ourselves make our boast in you in the assemblies of God for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations, which ye are sustaining;</p>

<p><a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that ye should be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for the sake of which ye also suffer; <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> if at least it is a righteous thing with God to render tribulation to those that trouble you, <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and to you that are troubled repose with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with the angels of his power, <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who know not God, and those who do not obey the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ; <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> who shall pay the penalty of everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his might, <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> when he shall have come to be glorified in his saints, and wondered at in all that have believed, (for our testimony to you has been believed,) in that day.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> To which end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of the calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith with power, <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> so that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and ye in him, according to the grace of our God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
