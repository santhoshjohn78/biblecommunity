<h2>Psalms 111</h2>

<p><a id="c111_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Hallelujah! I will celebrate Jehovah with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in the assembly. <a id="c111_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Great are the works of Jehovah; sought out of all that delight in them. <a id="c111_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> His work is majesty and splendour, and his righteousness abideth for ever. <a id="c111_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He hath made his wonders to be remembered: Jehovah is gracious and merciful. <a id="c111_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He hath given meat unto them that fear him; he is ever mindful of his covenant.</p>

<p><a id="c111_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He hath shewn his people the power of his works, to give them the heritage of the nations. <a id="c111_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The works of his hands are truth and judgment; all his precepts are faithful: <a id="c111_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Maintained for ever and ever, done in truth and uprightness. <a id="c111_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He sent deliverance unto his people; he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and terrible is his name. <a id="c111_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do his precepts: his praise abideth for ever.</p>
