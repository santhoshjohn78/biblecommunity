<h2>Revelation 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I saw another sign in the heaven, great and wonderful: seven angels having seven plagues, the last; for in them the fury of God is completed. <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And I saw as a glass sea, mingled with fire, and those that had gained the victory over the beast, and over its image, and over the number of its name, standing upon the glass sea, having harps of God. <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And they sing the song of Moses bondman of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful are thy works, Lord God Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, O King of nations. <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all nations shall come and do homage before thee; for thy righteousnesses have been made manifest.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of witness in the heaven was opened; <a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in pure bright linen, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles. <a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls, full of the fury of God, who lives to the ages of ages. <a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power: and no one could enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.</p>
