<h2>Exodus 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah said to Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am Jehovah. <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as the Almighty Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> but by my name Jehovah I was not made known to them. <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And I established also my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were sojourners. <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And I have heard also the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians have forced to serve, and I have remembered my covenant. <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Therefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their service, and I will redeem you with a stretched-out arm, and with great judgments. <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I will take you to me for a people, and will be your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> and ye shall know that I, Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> am he who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I will bring you into the land concerning which I swore to give it unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; and I will give it you for a possession: I am Jehovah. <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Moses spoke thus to the children of Israel; but they did not listen to Moses from anguish of spirit, and from hard service.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, <a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Moses spoke before Jehovah, saying, Lo, the children of Israel do not hearken to me: how then should Pharaoh hearken to me, to me of uncircumcised lips? <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a commandment to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.</p>
