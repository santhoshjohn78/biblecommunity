<h2>1 Samuel 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was rare in those days; a vision was not frequent. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli lay in his place (now his eyes began to grow dim, he could not see), <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and the lamp of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> had not yet gone out, and Samuel lay in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> was, <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> that Jehovah called to Samuel. And he said, Here am I. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I did not call: lie down again. And he went and lay down. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Jehovah called again, Samuel! And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I did not call, my son: lie down again. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither had the word of Jehovah yet been revealed to him. <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Jehovah called again the third time, Samuel! And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah was calling the boy. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah, for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at the other times, Samuel, Samuel! And Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant heareth.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house; I will begin and make an end. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For I have declared to him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he hath known: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice or oblation for ever. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to declare the vision to Eli. <a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And he said, What is the word that he has spoken to thee? I pray thee, keep it not back from me: God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> do so to thee, and more also, if thou keep back anything from me of all the word that he spoke to thee. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Samuel told him all the words, and kept nothing back from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what is good in his sight.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah. <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Jehovah appeared again at Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.</p>
