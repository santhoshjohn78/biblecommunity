<h2>Deuteronomy 26</h2>

<p><a id="c26_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it shall be when thou comest into the land that Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein, <a id="c26_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which thou shalt bring of thy land which Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place that Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> will choose to cause his name to dwell there; <a id="c26_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and thou shalt come unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> that I am come unto the land that Jehovah swore unto our fathers to give us. <a id="c26_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand, and set it down before the altar of Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a>  <a id="c26_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And thou shalt speak and say before Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> A perishing Aramaean was my father, and he went down to Egypt with a few, and sojourned there, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous. <a id="c26_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the Egyptians evil-entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage; <a id="c26_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and we cried to Jehovah, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> of our fathers, and Jehovah heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression; <a id="c26_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt with a powerful hand, and with a stretched-out arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders; <a id="c26_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey! <a id="c26_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruits of the land, which thou, Jehovah, hast given me. And thou shalt set it down before Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> and worship before Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a>  <a id="c26_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And thou shalt rejoice in all the good that Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote10">*</a> hath given to thee, and to thy house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that is in thy midst.</p>

<p><a id="c26_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thy produce in the third year, the year of tithing, thou shalt give it to the Levite, to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat in thy gates, and be filled; <a id="c26_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and thou shalt say before Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote11">*</a> I have brought away the hallowed things out of the house, and also have given them to the Levite, and to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandment which thou hast commanded me; I have not transgressed nor forgotten any of thy commandments: <a id="c26_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I brought away thereof in uncleanness, nor given thereof for a dead person; I have hearkened to the voice of Jehovah my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote12">*</a> I have done according to all that thou hast commanded me. <a id="c26_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Look down from thy holy habitation, from the heavens, and bless thy people Israel, and the land that thou hast given us as thou didst swear unto our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey!</p>

<p><a id="c26_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> This day Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote13">*</a> hath commanded thee to do these statutes and ordinances; and thou shalt keep and do them with all thy heart and with all thy soul. <a id="c26_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Thou hast this day accepted Jehovah to be thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote14">*</a> and to walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and to hearken unto his voice; <a id="c26_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and Jehovah hath accepted thee this day to be a people of possession to him, as he hath told thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments, <a id="c26_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> so that he should make thee high above all the nations which he hath made, in praise and in name and in honour; and that thou shouldest be a holy people to Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote15">*</a> as he hath said.</p>
