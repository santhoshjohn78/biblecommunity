<h2>Zechariah 7</h2>

<p><a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chislev, <a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> when Bethel had sent Sherezer and Regem-melech, and his men, to supplicate Jehovah, <a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and to speak unto the priests that were in the house of Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done now so many years? <a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me, saying, <a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye really fast unto me, even unto me? <a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And when ye ate, and when ye drank, was it not you that were eating and drinking? <a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Are not these the words that Jehovah cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and at peace, and her cities round about her, when the south and the lowland were inhabited?</p>

<p><a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah, saying, <a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew loving-kindness and mercies one to another, <a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and oppress not the widow and the fatherless, the stranger and the afflicted; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. <a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But they refused to hearken, and turned a rebellious shoulder, and made their ears heavy, that they should not hear. <a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And they made their heart as an adamant, that they should not hear the law, and the words that Jehovah of hosts sent by his Spirit by the hand of the former prophets: therefore was there great wrath from Jehovah of hosts. <a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And it came to pass, like as he called, and they would not hear, so they called, and I would not hear, saith Jehovah of hosts; <a id="c7_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not, and the land was desolate after them, so that no one passed through nor returned; and they laid the pleasant land desolate.</p>
