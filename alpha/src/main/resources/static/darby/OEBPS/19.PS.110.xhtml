<h2>Psalms 110</h2>

<p><a id="c110_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I put thine enemies as footstool of thy feet. <a id="c110_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah shall send the sceptre of thy might out of Zion: rule in the midst of thine enemies. <a id="c110_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in holy splendour: from the womb of the morning shall come to thee the dew of thy youth. <a id="c110_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek.</p>

<p><a id="c110_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The Lord at thy right hand will smite through kings in the day of his anger. <a id="c110_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> He shall judge among the nations; he shall fill all places with dead bodies; he shall smite through the head over a great country. <a id="c110_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall he lift up the head.</p>
