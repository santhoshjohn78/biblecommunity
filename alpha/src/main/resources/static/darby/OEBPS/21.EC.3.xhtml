<h2>Ecclesiastes 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heavens: <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> A time to be born, and a time to die; A time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> A time to kill, and a time to heal; A time to break down, and a time to build up; <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> A time to weep, and a time to laugh; A time to mourn, and a time to dance; <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> A time to seek, and a time to lose; A time to keep, and a time to cast away; <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> A time to rend, and a time to sew; A time to keep silence, and a time to speak; <a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> A time to love, and a time to hate; A time of war, and a time of peace. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> What profit hath he that worketh from that wherein he laboureth? <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I have seen the travail that God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> hath given to the sons of men to toil in.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> He hath made everything beautiful in its time; also he hath set the world in their heart, so that man findeth not out from the beginning to the end the work that God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> doeth. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> I know that there is nothing good for them but to rejoice and to do well in their life; <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> yea also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labour, it is the gift of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a>  <a id="c3_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I know that whatever God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> doeth, it shall be for ever; there is nothing to be added to it, nor anything to be taken from it; and God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> doeth it, that men should fear before him. <a id="c3_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> That which is was long ago, and that which is to be hath already been; and God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> bringeth back again that which is past.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And moreover I saw under the sun, that in the place of judgment, wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, wickedness was there. <a id="c3_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> I said in my heart, God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. <a id="c3_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> I said in my heart, It is thus with the children of men, that God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> may prove them, and that they should see that they themselves are but beasts. <a id="c3_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For what befalleth the children of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other, and they have all one breath; and man hath no pre-eminence above the beast: for all is vanity. <a id="c3_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> All go unto one place: all are of the dust, and all return to dust. <a id="c3_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Who knoweth the spirit of the children of men? Doth it go upwards? and the spirit of the beasts, doth it go downwards to the earth? <a id="c3_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And I have seen that there is nothing better than that man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</p>
