<h2>Psalms 58</h2>

<p><a id="c58_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Is righteousness indeed silent? Do ye speak it? Do ye judge with equity, ye sons of men? <a id="c58_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth. <a id="c58_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> The wicked go astray from the womb; they err as soon as they are born, speaking lies. <a id="c58_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder which stoppeth her ear; <a id="c58_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Which doth not hearken to the voice of enchanters, of one charming ever so wisely.</p>

<p><a id="c58_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> break their teeth in their mouth; break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Jehovah. <a id="c58_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Let them melt away as waters that flow off; when he aimeth his arrows, let them be as blunted: <a id="c58_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Let them be as a snail that melteth as it passeth away; like the untimely birth of a woman, let them not see the sun. <a id="c58_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Before your pots feel the thorns, green or burning, --they shall be whirled away. <a id="c58_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his footsteps in the blood of the wicked: <a id="c58_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And men shall say, Verily there is fruit for the righteous; verily there is a God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> that judgeth in the earth.</p>
