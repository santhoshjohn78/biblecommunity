<h2>Isaiah 37</h2>

<p><a id="c37_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his garments, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah. <a id="c37_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz. <a id="c37_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of reviling; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. <a id="c37_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> It may be Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> will hear the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> hath heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left. <a id="c37_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. <a id="c37_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. <a id="c37_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Behold, I will put a spirit into him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish. <a id="c37_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He has come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, <a id="c37_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Let not thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> upon whom thou reliest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. <a id="c37_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all countries, destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? <a id="c37_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Have the gods of the nations which my fathers have destroyed delivered them, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Thelassar? <a id="c37_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? <a id="c37_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up into the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah. <a id="c37_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying, <a id="c37_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Jehovah of hosts, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> of Israel, who sittest between the cherubim, thou, the Same, thou alone art the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made the heavens and the earth. <a id="c37_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open, Jehovah, thine eyes, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to reproach the living God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a>  <a id="c37_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the lands, and their countries, <a id="c37_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; and they have destroyed them. <a id="c37_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And now, Jehovah our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> save us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah, thou only.</p>

<p><a id="c37_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a> of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria, <a id="c37_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> this is the word which Jehovah hath spoken against him: The virgin-daughter of Zion despiseth thee, laugheth thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head at thee. <a id="c37_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted the voice? Against the Holy One of Israel hast thou lifted up thine eyes on high. <a id="c37_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> By thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the recesses of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, the choice of its cypresses; and I will enter into its furthest height, into the forest of its fruitful field. <a id="c37_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> I have digged and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the streams of Matsor. <a id="c37_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Hast thou not heard that long ago I did it, and that from ancient days I formed it? Now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps. <a id="c37_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And their inhabitants were powerless, they were dismayed and put to shame; they were as the grass of the field and the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and grain blighted before it be grown up. <a id="c37_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> But I know thine abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me. <a id="c37_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Because thy raging against me and thine arrogance is come up into mine ears, I will put my ring in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will make thee go back by the way by which thou camest. <a id="c37_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And this shall be the sign unto thee: there shall be eaten this year such as groweth of itself; and in the second year that which springeth of the same; but in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof. <a id="c37_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward; <a id="c37_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that escape: the zeal of Jehovah of hosts shall do this. <a id="c37_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it. <a id="c37_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith Jehovah. <a id="c37_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. <a id="c37_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And an angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand. And when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead bodies. <a id="c37_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and abode at Nineveh. <a id="c37_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</p>
