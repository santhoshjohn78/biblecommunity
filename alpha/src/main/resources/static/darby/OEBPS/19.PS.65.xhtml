<h2>Psalms 65</h2>

<p><a id="c65_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Praise waiteth for thee in silence, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> in Zion; and unto thee shall the vow be performed. <a id="c65_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come. <a id="c65_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Iniquities have prevailed against me: our transgressions, thou wilt forgive them. <a id="c65_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Blessed is he whom thou choosest and causest to approach: he shall dwell in thy courts. We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, of thy holy temple. <a id="c65_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of our salvation, thou confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of the distant regions of the sea. ...</p>

<p><a id="c65_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Who by his strength established the mountains, being girded with power; <a id="c65_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Who stilleth the raging of the seas, the raging of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples. <a id="c65_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And they that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens; thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. <a id="c65_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Thou hast visited the earth, thou hast watered it; thou greatly enrichest it: the river of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> is full of water; thou providest their corn, when thou hast so prepared it: <a id="c65_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Thou dost satiate its furrows, thou smoothest its clods, thou makest it soft with showers; thou blessest the springing thereof. <a id="c65_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Thou crownest the year with thy goodness, and thy paths drop fatness: <a id="c65_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness, and the hills are girded with gladness. <a id="c65_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The meadows are clothed with flocks, and the valleys are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, yea, they sing.</p>
