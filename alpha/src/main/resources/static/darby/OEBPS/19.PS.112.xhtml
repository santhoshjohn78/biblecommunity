<h2>Psalms 112</h2>

<p><a id="c112_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Hallelujah! Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah, that delighteth greatly in his commandments. <a id="c112_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> His seed shall be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright shall be blessed. <a id="c112_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Wealth and riches shall be in his house; and his righteousness abideth for ever. <a id="c112_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness; he is gracious, and merciful, and righteous. <a id="c112_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> It is well with the man that is gracious and lendeth; he will sustain his cause in judgment.</p>

<p><a id="c112_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. <a id="c112_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed confiding in Jehovah; <a id="c112_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> His heart is maintained, he is not afraid, until he see his desire upon his oppressors. <a id="c112_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He scattereth abroad, he giveth to the needy; his righteousness abideth for ever: his horn shall be exalted with honour. <a id="c112_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> The wicked man shall see it and be vexed; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.</p>
