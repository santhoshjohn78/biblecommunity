<h2>2 Samuel 7</h2>

<p><a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass when the king dwelt in his house, and Jehovah had given him rest round about from all his enemies, <a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> that the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedars, and the ark of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> dwells under curtains. <a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And it came to pass that night that the word of Jehovah came to Nathan, saying, <a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Go and say to my servant, to David, Thus saith Jehovah: Wilt thou build me a house for me to dwell in? <a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but I went about in a tent and in a tabernacle. <a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> In all my going about with all the children of Israel, did I speak a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye me not a house of cedars? <a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And now, thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I took thee from the pasture-grounds, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people, over Israel; <a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are on the earth. <a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And I will appoint a place for my people, for Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and be disturbed no more; neither shall the sons of wickedness afflict them any more, as formerly, <a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. And I have given thee rest from all thine enemies; and Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house. <a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. <a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> It is he who shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever. <a id="c7_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the sons of men; <a id="c7_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> but my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before thee. <a id="c7_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made firm for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever. <a id="c7_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And king David went in and sat before Jehovah, and said, Who am I, Lord Jehovah, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? <a id="c7_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And yet this hath been a small thing in thy sight, Lord Jehovah; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, Lord Jehovah? <a id="c7_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And what can David say more to thee? for thou, Lord Jehovah, knowest thy servant. <a id="c7_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, to make thy servant know it. <a id="c7_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Wherefore thou art great, Jehovah Elohim; for there is none like thee, neither is there any God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. <a id="c7_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And who is like thy people, like Israel, the one nation in the earth that God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> went to redeem to be a people to himself, and to make himself a name, and to do for them great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thyself from Egypt, from the nations and their gods? <a id="c7_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And thou hast established to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, Jehovah, art become their God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a>  <a id="c7_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And now, Jehovah Elohim, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house, fulfil it for ever, and do as thou hast said. <a id="c7_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> over Israel; and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee. <a id="c7_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> For thou, Jehovah of hosts, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house; therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee. <a id="c7_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And now, Lord Jehovah, thou art that God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> and thy words are true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant; <a id="c7_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever; for thou, Lord Jehovah, hast spoken it; and with thy blessing shall the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</p>
