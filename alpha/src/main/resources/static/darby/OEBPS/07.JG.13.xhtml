<h2>Judges 13</h2>

<p><a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah gave them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. <a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And there was a certain man of Zoreah, of the family of the Danites, and his name was Manoah. And his wife was barren and did not bear. <a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold now, thou art barren and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive and bear a son. <a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And now beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat nothing unclean. <a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son, and no razor shall come on his head; for the boy shall be a Nazarite of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> from the womb; and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. <a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> very terrible; but I did not ask him whence he was, neither did he tell me his name. <a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And he said to me, Behold, thou shalt conceive and bear a son; and now drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not anything unclean; for the boy shall be a Nazarite of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> from the womb to the day of his death.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Then Manoah prayed to Jehovah, and said, Ah Lord! let the man of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> which thou didst send come again unto us, I pray thee, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born. <a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the Angel of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> came again to the woman whilst she sat in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her. <a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Then the woman hasted and ran, and informed her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man has appeared to me, that came to me that day. <a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Manoah rose up and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Art thou the man that didst speak to the woman? And he said, I am. <a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Manoah said, When thy words then come to pass, what shall be the child's manner and his doing? <a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware: <a id="c13_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> she shall not eat of anything that cometh of the vine, neither shall she drink wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean: all that I commanded her shall she observe.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, and we will make ready a kid of the goats for thee. <a id="c13_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah, Though thou shouldest detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt offer a burnt-offering, thou shalt offer it up to Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was the Angel of Jehovah. <a id="c13_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah, What is thy name, that when thy word cometh to pass we may do thee honour? <a id="c13_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, How is it that thou askest after my name, seeing it is wonderful? <a id="c13_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Then Manoah took the kid and the oblation, and offered it up to Jehovah upon the rock. And he did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on. <a id="c13_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And it came to pass, as the flame went up from off the altar towards the heavens, that the Angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar; and Manoah and his wife looked on, and fell on their faces to the ground. <a id="c13_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the Angel of Jehovah appeared no more to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that it was the Angel of Jehovah. <a id="c13_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a>  <a id="c13_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> But his wife said to him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and an oblation at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would he at this time have told us such things as these.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him. <a id="c13_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him at Mahaneh-Dan, between Zoreah and Eshtaol.</p>
