<h2>2 Corinthians 9</h2>

<p><a id="c9_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> For concerning the ministration which is for the saints, it is superfluous my writing to you. <a id="c9_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For I know your readiness, which I boast of as respects you to Macedonians, that Achaia is prepared since a year ago, and the zeal reported of you has stimulated the mass of the brethren. <a id="c9_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But I have sent the brethren, in order that our boasting about you may not be made void in this respect, in order that, as I have said, ye may be prepared; <a id="c9_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> lest haply, if Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we, that we say not ye, may be put to shame in this confidence. <a id="c9_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I thought it necessary therefore to beg the brethren that they would come to you, and complete beforehand your fore-announced blessing, that this may be ready thus as blessing, and not as got out of you.</p>

<p><a id="c9_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> But this is true, he that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that sows in the spirit of blessing shall reap also in blessing: <a id="c9_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> each according as he is purposed in his heart; not grievingly, or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver. <a id="c9_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But God is able to make every gracious gift abound towards you, that, having in every way always all-sufficiency, ye may abound to every good work: <a id="c9_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> according as it is written, He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor, his righteousness remains for ever. <a id="c9_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Now he that supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating shall supply and make abundant your sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness: <a id="c9_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> enriched in every way unto all free-hearted liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God. <a id="c9_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Because the ministration of this service is not only filling up the measure of what is lacking to the saints, but also abounding by many thanksgivings to God; <a id="c9_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> they glorifying God through the proof of this ministration, by reason of your subjection, by profession, to the glad tidings of the Christ, and your free-hearted liberality in communicating towards them and towards all; <a id="c9_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and in their supplication for you, full of ardent desire for you, on account of the exceeding grace of God which is upon you. <a id="c9_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift.</p>
