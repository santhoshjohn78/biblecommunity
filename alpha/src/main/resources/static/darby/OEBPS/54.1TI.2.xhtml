<h2>1 Timothy 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men; <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> for kings and all that are in dignity, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity; <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> for this is good and acceptable before our Saviour God, <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> who desires that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus, <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony to be rendered in its own times; <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> to which I have been appointed a herald and apostle, (I speak the truth, I do not lie,) a teacher of the nations in faith and truth. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I will therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up pious hands, without wrath or reasoning.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> In like manner also that the women in decent deportment and dress adorn themselves with modesty and discretion, not with plaited hair and gold, or pearls, or costly clothing, <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> but, what becomes women making profession of the fear of God, by good works. <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection; <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> but I do not suffer a woman to teach nor to exercise authority over man, but to be in quietness; <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> for Adam was formed first, then Eve: <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been deceived, was in transgression. <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But she shall be preserved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with discretion.</p>
