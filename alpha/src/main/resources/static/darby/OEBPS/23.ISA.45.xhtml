<h2>Isaiah 45</h2>

<p><a id="c45_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Thus saith Jehovah to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him--and I will loose the loins of kings; to open before him the two-leaved doors, and the gates shall not be shut: <a id="c45_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I will go before thee, and make the elevated places plain; I will break in pieces the brazen doors, and cut asunder the bars of iron; <a id="c45_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places; that thou mayest know that I, Jehovah, who call thee by name, am the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of Israel. <a id="c45_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have called thee by thy name; I surnamed thee, though thou didst not know me;</p>

<p><a id="c45_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I am Jehovah, and there is none else; there is no God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> beside me: I girded thee, and thou hast not known me; <a id="c45_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> --that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the going down, that there is none beside me. I am Jehovah, and there is none else; <a id="c45_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> forming the light and creating darkness, making peace and creating evil: I, Jehovah, do all these things. <a id="c45_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and with it let righteousness spring up. I, Jehovah, have created it. <a id="c45_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let a potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that formeth it, What makest thou? Or thy work, He hath no hands? <a id="c45_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? Or to his mother, What hast thou brought forth?</p>

<p><a id="c45_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask me of the things to come; concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me. <a id="c45_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> It is I that have made the earth, and created man upon it; it is I, my hands, that have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded. <a id="c45_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> It is I that have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make all his ways straight: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith Jehovah of hosts. <a id="c45_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Thus saith Jehovah: The wealth of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall walk after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall bow down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> is in thee; and there is none else, no other God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> ... <a id="c45_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Verily thou art a 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> that hidest thyself, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> of Israel, the Saviour. ... <a id="c45_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them; they shall go away in confusion together, the makers of idols. <a id="c45_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Israel shall be saved by Jehovah with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded, unto the ages of ages. <a id="c45_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> For thus saith Jehovah who created the heavens, God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> himself who formed the earth and made it, he who established it, --not as waste did he create it: he formed it to be inhabited: --I am Jehovah, and there is none else. <a id="c45_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth; I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek me in vain: I am Jehovah, speaking righteousness, declaring things which are right.</p>

<p><a id="c45_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Gather yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations. They have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> that cannot save. <a id="c45_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Declare and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath caused this to be heard from ancient time? who hath declared it long ago? Is it not I, Jehovah? And there is no God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a> else beside me; a just 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote10">*</a> and a Saviour, there is none besides me. <a id="c45_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote11">*</a> and there is none else. <a id="c45_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return, that unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. <a id="c45_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Only in Jehovah, shall one say, have I righteousness and strength. To him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed. <a id="c45_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> In Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.</p>
