<h2>Deuteronomy 24</h2>

<p><a id="c24_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> When a man taketh a wife, and marrieth her, it shall be if she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a letter of divorce, and give it into her hand, and send her out of his house. <a id="c24_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And she shall depart out of his house, and go away, and may become another man's wife. <a id="c24_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a letter of divorce, and give it into her hand, and send her out of his house; or if the latter husband die who took her as his wife; <a id="c24_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> her first husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for it is an abomination before Jehovah; and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> giveth thee for an inheritance.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> When a man hath newly taken a wife, he shall not go out with the army, neither shall any kind of business be imposed upon him; he shall be free for his house one year, and shall gladden his wife whom he hath taken. <a id="c24_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> No man shall take the hand-mill or the upper millstone in pledge; for it would be taking life in pledge. <a id="c24_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> If a man be found who hath stolen one of his brethren of the children of Israel, and who hath treated him as a slave and sold him, that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from thy midst. <a id="c24_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou take great heed, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them shall ye take heed to do. <a id="c24_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Remember what Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> did unto Miriam on the way, after that ye came forth out of Egypt. <a id="c24_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> When thou dost lend thy brother anything, thou shalt not go into his house to secure his pledge. <a id="c24_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Thou shalt stand outside, and the man to whom thou hast made a loan shall bring out the pledge to thee without. <a id="c24_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And if the man be needy, thou shalt not lie down with his pledge; <a id="c24_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> in any case thou shalt return him the pledge at the going down of the sun, that he may sleep in his own upper garment and bless thee; and it shall be righteousness unto thee before Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a></p>

<p><a id="c24_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy of thy brethren, or of thy sojourners who are in thy land within thy gates: <a id="c24_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> on his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and his soul yearneth after it; lest he cry against thee to Jehovah, and it be a sin in thee. <a id="c24_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The fathers shall not be put to death for the sons, neither shall the sons be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin. <a id="c24_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, or of the fatherless; and thou shalt not take in pledge a widow's garment. <a id="c24_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and that Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> redeemed thee from thence; therefore I command thee to do this thing. <a id="c24_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> When thou reapest thy harvest in thy field, and forgettest a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not return to fetch it; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> may bless thee in all the work of thy hands. <a id="c24_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> When thou shakest thine olive-tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. <a id="c24_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterwards; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. <a id="c24_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt; therefore I command thee to do this thing.</p>
