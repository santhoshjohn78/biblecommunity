<h2>Jeremiah 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying, <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Hear ye the words of this covenant; and speak ye unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of Israel: Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Hearken unto my voice and do them, according to all that I command you; so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a>  <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> that I may perform the oath that I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. And I answered and said, Amen, Jehovah! <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Jehovah said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear the words of this covenant, and do them. <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For I earnestly protested unto your fathers, in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Hearken unto my voice. <a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But they have not hearkened, nor inclined their ear, but have walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart; and I have brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, and they have not done. <a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Jehovah said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will bring evil upon them, from which they shall not be able to escape; and they will cry unto me, and I will not hearken unto them. <a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they have burned incense; but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble. <a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For as the number of thy cities, are thy gods, O Judah; and as the number of the streets of Jerusalem, have ye set up altars to the Shame, altars to burn incense unto Baal. <a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And thou, pray not for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble. <a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> What hath my beloved to do in my house, seeing that the more part practise their evil devices, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? When thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest. <a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Jehovah had called thy name, A green olive-tree, fair, of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and its branches are broken. <a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For Jehovah of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done for themselves, to provoke me to anger in burning incense unto Baal.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Jehovah hath given me knowledge, and I know it; then thou shewedst me their doings. <a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And I was like a tame lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I knew not that they devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered. <a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> But thou, Jehovah of hosts, who judgest righteously, who triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause. <a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of Jehovah, that thou die not by our hand, <a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> --therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine; <a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and there shall be no remnant of them; for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, in the year of their visitation.</p>
