<h2>Psalms 24</h2>

<p><a id="c24_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The earth is Jehovah's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. <a id="c24_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For it was he that founded it upon seas, and established it upon floods.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Who shall ascend into the mount of Jehovah? and who shall stand in his holy place? <a id="c24_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> He that hath blameless hands and a pure heart; who lifteth not up his soul unto vanity, nor sweareth deceitfully: <a id="c24_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He shall receive blessing from Jehovah, and righteousness from the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of his salvation. <a id="c24_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> This is the generation of them that seek unto him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Lift up your heads, ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. <a id="c24_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Who is this King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle. <a id="c24_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Lift up your heads, ye gates; yea, lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. <a id="c24_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Who is he, this King of glory? Jehovah of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.</p>
