<h2>Jeremiah 28</h2>

<p><a id="c28_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of Jehovah, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying, <a id="c28_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. <a id="c28_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Jehovah's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon; <a id="c28_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah that went to Babylon, saith Jehovah: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. <a id="c28_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the prophet Jeremiah spoke unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of Jehovah. <a id="c28_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen, may Jehovah do so! may Jehovah perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again from Babylon, into this place, the vessels of Jehovah's house, and all them of the captivity! <a id="c28_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Nevertheless, hear, I pray thee, this word which I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people: <a id="c28_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old, prophesied also concerning many countries and concerning great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. <a id="c28_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, shall be known as the prophet whom Jehovah hath really sent.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the prophet Hananiah took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it. <a id="c28_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: So will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way. <a id="c28_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, after that the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, <a id="c28_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast broken the yokes of wood, and thou hast made in their place yokes of iron. <a id="c28_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also. <a id="c28_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah, Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah hath not sent thee; and thou makest this people to trust in falsehood. <a id="c28_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, for thou hast spoken revolt against Jehovah. <a id="c28_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the prophet Hananiah died in the same year in the seventh month.</p>
