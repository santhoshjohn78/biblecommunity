<h2>Song of Solomon 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, beloved ones!</p>

<p><a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I slept, but my heart was awake. The voice of my beloved! he knocketh: Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, mine undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> --I have put off my tunic, how should I put it on? I have washed my feet, how should I pollute them? -- <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door; And my bowels yearned for him. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands dropped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, Upon the handles of the lock. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had withdrawn himself; he was gone: My soul went forth when he spoke. I sought him, but I found him not; I called him, but he gave me no answer. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The watchmen that went about the city found me; They smote me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away my veil from me. <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, If ye find my beloved, ...What will ye tell him? --That I am sick of love.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> What is thy beloved more than another beloved, Thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than another beloved, That thou dost so charge us? <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> My beloved is white and ruddy, The chiefest among ten thousand. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> His head is as the finest gold; His locks are flowing, black as the raven; <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> His eyes are like doves by the water-brooks, Washed with milk, fitly set; <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> His cheeks are as a bed of spices, raised beds of sweet plants; His lips lilies, dropping liquid myrrh. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> His hands gold rings, set with the chrysolite; His belly is bright ivory, overlaid with sapphires; <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> His legs, pillars of marble, set upon bases of fine gold: His bearing as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars; <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> His mouth is most sweet: Yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, yea, this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</p>
