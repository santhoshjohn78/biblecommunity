<h2>Exodus 34</h2>

<p><a id="c34_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah said to Moses, Hew for thyself two tables of stone like the first; and I will write upon the tables the words that were upon the first tables, which thou hast broken. <a id="c34_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And be ready for the morning, and go up in the morning to mount Sinai, and stand there before me on the top of the mountain. <a id="c34_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And let no man go up with thee, neither shall any man be seen on all the mountain; neither shall sheep and oxen feed in front of that mountain. <a id="c34_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he hewed two tables of stone like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.</p>

<p><a id="c34_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and stood beside him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah. <a id="c34_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Jehovah passed by before his face, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah ·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in goodness and truth, <a id="c34_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> keeping mercy unto thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but by no means clearing the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation. <a id="c34_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Moses made haste, and bowed his head to the earth and worshipped, <a id="c34_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and said, If indeed I have found grace in thine eyes, Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go in our midst; for it is a stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for an inheritance!</p>

<p><a id="c34_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels that have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people in the midst of which thou art shall see the work of Jehovah; for a terrible thing it shall be that I will do with thee. <a id="c34_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Observe what I command thee this day: behold, I will drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. <a id="c34_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Take heed to thyself, that thou make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which thou shalt come, lest it be a snare in the midst of thee; <a id="c34_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> but ye shall demolish their altars, shatter their statues, and hew down their Asherahs. <a id="c34_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For thou shalt worship no other ·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> for Jehovah--Jealous is his name--is a jealous ·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a>  <a id="c34_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and then, when they go a whoring after their gods, and sacrifice unto their gods, thou be invited, and eat of their sacrifice, <a id="c34_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods. <a id="c34_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> --Thou shalt make thyself no molten gods.</p>

<p><a id="c34_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> --The feast of the unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I have commanded thee, at the appointed time of the month Abib; for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. <a id="c34_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> --All that openeth the womb is mine; and all the cattle that is born a male, the firstling of ox and sheep. <a id="c34_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> But the firstling of an ass thou shalt ransom with a lamb; and if thou ransom it not, then shalt thou break its neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt ransom; and none shall appear before me empty. <a id="c34_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> --Six days shalt thou work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; in ploughing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. <a id="c34_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> --And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the first-fruits of wheat-harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the turn of the year. <a id="c34_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Thrice in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord Jehovah, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> of Israel. <a id="c34_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> For I will dispossess the nations before thee, and enlarge thy border, and no man shall desire thy land, when thou goest up to appear before the face of Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> thrice in the year. <a id="c34_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> --Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left over night until the morning. <a id="c34_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> --The first of the first-fruits of thy land shalt thou bring into the house of Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk. <a id="c34_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And Jehovah said to Moses, Write thee these words; for after the tenor of these words have I made a covenant with thee and with Israel.</p>

<p><a id="c34_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> --And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he ate no bread, and drank no water. --And he wrote on the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words. <a id="c34_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai--and the two tables of testimony were in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mountain--that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone through his talking with him. <a id="c34_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him. <a id="c34_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And Moses called to them; and they turned to him, --Aaron and all the principal men of the assembly; and Moses talked with them. <a id="c34_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And afterwards, all the children of Israel came near; and he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him on mount Sinai. <a id="c34_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And Moses ended speaking with them; and he had put on his face a veil. <a id="c34_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel what he was commanded. <a id="c34_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone; and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</p>
