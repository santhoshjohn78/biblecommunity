<h2>Jeremiah 24</h2>

<p><a id="c24_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah shewed me, and behold, two baskets of figs, set before the temple of Jehovah, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive from Jerusalem, Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, and the craftsmen and smiths, and had brought them to Babylon. <a id="c24_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> One basket had very good figs, like the figs first ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten for badness. <a id="c24_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Jehovah said unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs: the good figs very good; and the bad very bad, which cannot be eaten for badness. <a id="c24_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, <a id="c24_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thus saith Jehovah, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard for good them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans; <a id="c24_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land; and I will build them and not pull them down, and I will plant them and not pluck them up. <a id="c24_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> for they shall return unto me with their whole heart. <a id="c24_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten for badness, surely, thus saith Jehovah: So will I make Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the remnant of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt. <a id="c24_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And I will give them over to be driven hither and thither unto all the kingdoms of the earth for evil, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them; <a id="c24_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and I will send among them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, until they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.</p>
