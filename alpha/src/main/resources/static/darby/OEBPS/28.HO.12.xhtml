<h2>Hosea 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Ephraim feedeth on wind, and pursueth after the east wind: all day long he multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah hath also a controversy with Judah, and he will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and in his strength he wrestled with God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a>  <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Yea, he wrestled with the Angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spoke with us, <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> --even Jehovah, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of hosts, --Jehovah is his memorial. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And thou, return unto thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> keep loving-kindness and judgment, and wait on thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> continually.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He is a merchant, balances of deceit are in his hand; he loveth to oppress. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Ephraim saith, Nevertheless I am become rich, I have found me out substance; in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin. <a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But I that am Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> from the land of Egypt will again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast. <a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And I have spoken to the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and by means of the prophets have I used similitudes. <a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> If Gilead is iniquity, surely they are but vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields. <a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep. <a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved. <a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly; and his Lord shall leave his blood upon him, and recompense unto him his reproach.</p>
