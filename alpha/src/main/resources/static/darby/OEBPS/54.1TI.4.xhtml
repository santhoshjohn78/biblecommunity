<h2>1 Timothy 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> But the Spirit speaks expressly, that in latter times some shall apostatise from the faith, giving their mind to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> speaking lies in hypocrisy, cauterised as to their own conscience, <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> forbidding to marry, bidding to abstain from meats, which God has created for receiving with thanksgiving for them who are faithful and know the truth. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, being received with thanksgiving; <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> for it is sanctified by God's word and freely addressing him.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Laying these things before the brethren, thou wilt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which thou hast fully followed up. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But profane and old wives' fables avoid, but exercise thyself unto piety; <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> for bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but piety is profitable for everything, having promise of life, of the present one, and of that to come. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The word is faithful and worthy of all acceptation; <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> for, for this we labour and suffer reproach, because we hope in a living God, who is preserver of all men, specially of those that believe. <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Enjoin and teach these things. <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Let no one despise thy youth, but be a model of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity. <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Till I come, give thyself to reading, to exhortation, to teaching. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Be not negligent of the gift that is in thee, which has been given to thee through prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the elderhood. <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Occupy thyself with these things; be wholly in them, that thy progress may be manifest to all. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Give heed to thyself and to the teaching; continue in them; for, doing this, thou shalt save both thyself and those that hear thee.</p>
