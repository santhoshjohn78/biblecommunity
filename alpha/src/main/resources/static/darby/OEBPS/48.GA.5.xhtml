<h2>Galatians 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Christ has set us free in freedom; stand fast therefore, and be not held again in a yoke of bondage. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Behold, I, Paul, say to you, that if ye are circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And I witness again to every man who is circumcised, that he is debtor to do the whole law. <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Ye are deprived of all profit from the Christ as separated from him, as many as are justified by law; ye have fallen from grace. <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For we, by the Spirit, on the principle of faith, await the hope of righteousness. <a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any force, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Ye ran well; who has stopped you that ye should not obey the truth? <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> The persuasibleness is not of him that calls you. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> A little leaven leavens the whole lump. <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I have confidence as to you in the Lord, that ye will have no other mind; and he that is troubling you shall bear the guilt of it, whosoever he may be. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> But I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why am I yet persecuted? Then the scandal of the cross has been done away. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> I would that they would even cut themselves off who throw you into confusion.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For ye have been called to liberty, brethren; only do not turn liberty into an opportunity to the flesh, but by love serve one another. <a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> but if ye bite and devour one another, see that ye are not consumed one of another. <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> But I say, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall no way fulfil flesh's lust. <a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these things are opposed one to the other, that ye should not do those things which ye desire; <a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> but if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under law. <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness, <a id="c5_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, disputes, schools of opinion, <a id="c5_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revels, and things like these; as to which I tell you beforehand, even as I also have said before, that they who do such things shall not inherit God's kingdom. <a id="c5_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, fidelity, <a id="c5_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> meekness, self-control: against such things there is no law. <a id="c5_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> But they that are of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts. <a id="c5_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> If we live by the Spirit, let us walk also by the Spirit. <a id="c5_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Let us not become vain-glorious, provoking one another, envying one another.</p>
