<h2>2 Corinthians 6</h2>

<p><a id="c6_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> But as fellow-workmen, we also beseech that ye receive not the grace of God in vain: <a id="c6_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> (for he says, I have listened to thee in an accepted time, and I have helped thee in a day of salvation: behold, now is the well-accepted time; behold, now the day of salvation:) <a id="c6_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> giving no manner of offence in anything, that the ministry be not blamed; <a id="c6_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> but in everything commending ourselves as God's ministers, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in straits, <a id="c6_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> in stripes, in prisons, in riots, in labours, in watchings, in fastings, <a id="c6_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned, <a id="c6_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> in the word of truth, in the power of God; through the arms of righteousness on the right hand and left, <a id="c6_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good report: as deceivers, and true; <a id="c6_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as disciplined, and not put to death; <a id="c6_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> as grieved, but always rejoicing; as poor, but enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things.</p>

<p><a id="c6_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians, our heart is expanded. <a id="c6_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your affections; <a id="c6_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> but for an answering recompense, (I speak as to children,) let your heart also expand itself. <a id="c6_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers; for what participation is there between righteousness and lawlessness? or what fellowship of light with darkness? <a id="c6_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and what consent of Christ with Beliar, or what part for a believer along with an unbeliever? <a id="c6_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and what agreement of God's temple with idols? for ye are the living God's temple; according as God has said, I will dwell among them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a people. <a id="c6_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, saith the Lord, and touch not what is unclean, and I will receive you; <a id="c6_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</p>
