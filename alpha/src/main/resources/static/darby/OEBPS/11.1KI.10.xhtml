<h2>1 Kings 10</h2>

<p><a id="c10_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon in connection with the name of Jehovah, and came to prove him with enigmas. <a id="c10_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices and gold in very great abundance, and precious stones; and she came to Solomon, and spoke to him of all that was in her heart. <a id="c10_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Solomon explained to her all she spoke of: there was not a thing hidden from the king that he did not explain to her. <a id="c10_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And when the queen of Sheba saw all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built, <a id="c10_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and the food of his table, and the deportment of his servants, and the order of service of his attendants, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah, there was no more spirit in her. <a id="c10_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine affairs, and of thy wisdom; <a id="c10_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> but I gave no credit to the words, until I came and mine eyes had seen; and behold, the half was not told me: in wisdom and prosperity thou exceedest the report that I heard. <a id="c10_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Happy are thy men! happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, who hear thy wisdom! <a id="c10_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Blessed be Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel! Because Jehovah loves Israel for ever, therefore did he make thee king, to do judgment and justice. <a id="c10_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in very great abundance, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as those which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. <a id="c10_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> (And the fleet also of Hiram, which carried gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir sandal-wood in very great abundance, and precious stones. <a id="c10_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the king made of the sandal-wood a balustrade for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, and harps and lutes for the singers. There came no such sandal-wood, nor was there seen to this day.) <a id="c10_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides what he gave her of the bounty of king Solomon. And she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.</p>

<p><a id="c10_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, <a id="c10_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> besides what came by the dealers, and by the traffic of the merchants, and by all the kings of Arabia, and by the governors of the country. <a id="c10_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold, --he applied six hundred shekels of gold to one target; <a id="c10_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and three hundred shields of beaten gold, --he applied three minas of gold to one shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. <a id="c10_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with refined gold: <a id="c10_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> the throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was rounded behind; and there were arms on each side at the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the arms; <a id="c10_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. <a id="c10_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of precious gold: none were of silver, which was not of the least account in the days of Solomon. <a id="c10_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For the king had on the sea a Tarshish-fleet, with the fleet of Hiram: once in three years came the Tarshish-fleet, bringing gold and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. <a id="c10_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And king Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. <a id="c10_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> had put in his heart. <a id="c10_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, and armour, and spices, horses and mules, a rate year by year. <a id="c10_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he placed them in the chariot-cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. <a id="c10_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he as the sycamores that are in the lowland for abundance. <a id="c10_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And the exportation of horses that Solomon had was from Egypt: a caravan of the king's merchants fetched a drove of horses, at a price. <a id="c10_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so they brought them by their means, for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria.</p>
