<h2>Proverbs 31</h2>

<p><a id="c31_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him: <a id="c31_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> What, my son? and what, O son of my womb? and what, O son of my vows? <a id="c31_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to them that destroy kings. <a id="c31_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for rulers to say, Where is the strong drink? <a id="c31_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> --lest they drink and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the children of affliction. <a id="c31_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter of soul: <a id="c31_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. <a id="c31_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Open thy mouth for the dumb, for the cause of all those that are left desolate. <a id="c31_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and minister justice to the afflicted and needy.</p>

<p><a id="c31_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Who can find a woman of worth? for her price is far above rubies. <a id="c31_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> The heart of her husband confideth in her, and he shall have no lack of spoil. <a id="c31_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> She doeth him good, and not evil, all the days of her life. <a id="c31_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. <a id="c31_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> She is like the merchants' ships: she bringeth her food from afar; <a id="c31_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And she riseth while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and the day's work to her maidens. <a id="c31_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> She considereth a field, and acquireth it; of the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. <a id="c31_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> She girdeth her loins with strength, and maketh strong her arms. <a id="c31_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> She perceiveth that her earning is good; her lamp goeth not out by night. <a id="c31_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> She putteth her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle. <a id="c31_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> She stretcheth out her hand to the afflicted, and she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. <a id="c31_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household are clothed with scarlet. <a id="c31_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> She maketh herself coverlets; her clothing is byssus and purple. <a id="c31_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. <a id="c31_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> She maketh body linen and selleth it, and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. <a id="c31_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laugheth at the coming day. <a id="c31_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and upon her tongue is the law of kindness. <a id="c31_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> She surveyeth the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. <a id="c31_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her: <a id="c31_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Many daughters have done worthily, but thou excellest them all. <a id="c31_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Gracefulness is deceitful and beauty is vain; a woman that feareth Jehovah, she shall be praised. <a id="c31_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates.</p>
