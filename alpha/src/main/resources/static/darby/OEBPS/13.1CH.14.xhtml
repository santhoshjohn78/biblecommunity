<h2>1 Chronicles 14</h2>

<p><a id="c14_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house. <a id="c14_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, for his kingdom was highly exalted, because of his people Israel. <a id="c14_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begot more sons and daughters. <a id="c14_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And these are the names of the children which he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, <a id="c14_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet, <a id="c14_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, <a id="c14_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.</p>

<p><a id="c14_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went out against them. <a id="c14_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. <a id="c14_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And David inquired of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines, and wilt thou give them into my hand? And Jehovah said to him, Go up; and I will give them into thy hand. <a id="c14_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> has broken in upon mine enemies by my hand, as the breaking forth of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim. <a id="c14_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And they left their gods there; and David commanded, and they were burned with fire. <a id="c14_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the Philistines yet again spread themselves in the valley. <a id="c14_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And David inquired again of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> and God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> said to him, Go not up after them; turn round them and come upon them opposite the mulberry-trees. <a id="c14_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> will have gone forth before thee to smite the army of the Philistines. <a id="c14_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And David did as God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> commanded him; and they smote the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer. <a id="c14_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all the nations.</p>
