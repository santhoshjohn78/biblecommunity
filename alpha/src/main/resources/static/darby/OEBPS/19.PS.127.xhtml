<h2>Psalms 127</h2>

<p><a id="c127_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unless Jehovah build the house, in vain do its builders labour in it; unless Jehovah keep the city, the keeper watcheth in vain: <a id="c127_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> It is vain for you to rise up early, to lie down late, to eat the bread of sorrows: so to his beloved one he giveth sleep. <a id="c127_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Lo, children are an inheritance from Jehovah, and the fruit of the womb a reward. <a id="c127_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth. <a id="c127_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Happy is the man that hath filled his quiver with them. They shall not be ashamed when they speak with enemies in the gate.</p>
