<h2>Judges 16</h2>

<p><a id="c16_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Samson went to Gazah, and saw there a harlot, and went in to her. <a id="c16_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And it was told the Gazathites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they surrounded him, and laid wait for him all night at the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning light we will kill him. <a id="c16_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Samson lay till midnight; and he arose at midnight, and seized the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and tore them up with the bar, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And it came to pass afterwards that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. <a id="c16_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Persuade him, and see in what his great strength is, and with what we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to overpower him; and we will each give thee eleven hundred silver-pieces. <a id="c16_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Then Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, in what is thy great strength, and with what thou mightest be bound to overpower thee. <a id="c16_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Samson said to her, If they should bind me with seven fresh cords which have not been dried, then should I be weak, and be as another man. <a id="c16_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them. <a id="c16_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Now she had liers in wait abiding in the chamber; and she said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson! And he broke the cords, as a thread of tow is broken when it touches the fire; and his strength was not known. <a id="c16_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me and told me lies. Now tell me, I pray thee, with what thou mightest be bound. <a id="c16_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And he said to her, If they should bind me fast with new ropes, with which no work has been done, then should I be weak, and be as another man. <a id="c16_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Delilah took new ropes, and bound him with them, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson! Now there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he broke them from off his arms like a thread. <a id="c16_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Delilah said to Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what thou mightest be bound. And he said to her, If thou shouldest weave the seven locks of my head with the web. <a id="c16_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And she fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson! And he awoke out of his sleep, and tore out the pin of the beam, and the web. <a id="c16_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Then she said to him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? these three times hast thou mocked me, and hast not told me in what is thy great strength. <a id="c16_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him, that his soul was vexed unto death; <a id="c16_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and he told her all his heart, and said to her, There has not come a razor upon my head; for I am a Nazarite of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> from my mother's womb; if I should be shaven, then my strength would go from me, and I should be weak, and be like all mankind.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, and she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this time, for he has told me all his heart. And the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in their hand. <a id="c16_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And she made him sleep upon her knees, and called a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to overpower him, and his strength went from him. <a id="c16_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson! And he awoke out of his sleep, and thought, I will go out as at other times before, and disengage myself. And he knew not that Jehovah had departed from him. <a id="c16_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the Philistines seized him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gazah, and bound him with fetters of bronze; and he had to grind in the prison-house.</p>

<p><a id="c16_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But the hair of his head began to grow after he was shaved. <a id="c16_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Then the lords of the Philistines gathered together to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hands. <a id="c16_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, Our god has given into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, even him who multiplied our slain. <a id="c16_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And it came to pass when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house, and he played before them; and they set him between the pillars. <a id="c16_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, Let loose of me, and suffer me to feel the pillars upon which the house stands, that I may lean upon them. <a id="c16_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and upon the roof there were about three thousand men and women, who looked on while Samson made sport. <a id="c16_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And Samson called to Jehovah, and said, Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> that I may take one vengeance upon the Philistines for my two eyes. <a id="c16_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood (and he supported himself upon them), the one with his right hand and the other with his left. <a id="c16_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines! And he bowed himself with might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people that were therein. So the dead that he slew at his death were more than those whom he had slain in his life. <a id="c16_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And his brethren came down, and all the house of his father, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zoreah and Eshtaol in the sepulchre of Manoah his father. And he had judged Israel twenty years.</p>
