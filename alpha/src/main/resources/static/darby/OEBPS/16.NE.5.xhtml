<h2>Nehemiah 5</h2>

<p><a id="c5_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews. <a id="c5_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many, and we must procure corn that we may eat and live. <a id="c5_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And there were that said, We have had to pledge our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses, that we might procure corn in the dearth. <a id="c5_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And there were that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute upon our fields and vineyards; <a id="c5_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and behold, we must bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage already; neither is it in the power of our hand to redeem them, for other men have our fields and our vineyards.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. <a id="c5_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I consulted with myself; and I remonstrated with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother! And I set a great assembly against them. <a id="c5_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I said to them, We, according to our ability, have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold to the nations; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? And they were silent and found no answer. <a id="c5_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And I said, The thing that ye do is not good. Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> so as not to be the reproach of the nations our enemies? <a id="c5_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I also, my brethren and my servants, we might exact usury of them, money and corn. I pray you, let us leave off this usury. <a id="c5_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Restore, I pray you, to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive-gardens, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine and the oil, that ye have exacted of them. <a id="c5_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And they said, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, as thou hast said. And I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise. <a id="c5_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Also I shook my lap, and said, So God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> shake out every man from his house and from his earnings, that performeth not this promise: even thus be he shaken out and emptied! And all the congregation said, Amen! And they praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.</p>

<p><a id="c5_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. <a id="c5_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> But the former governors that were before me had been chargeable to the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver: even their servants bore rule over the people. But I did not so, because of the fear of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a>  <a id="c5_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Yea, also I applied myself to this work of the wall, and we bought no fields; and all my servants were gathered thither for the work. <a id="c5_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and the rulers, besides those that came to us from among the nations that were about us. <a id="c5_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And that which was prepared daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days all sorts of wine in abundance. Yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor; for the service was heavy upon this people. <a id="c5_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Remember for me, my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> for good, all that I have done for this people.</p>
