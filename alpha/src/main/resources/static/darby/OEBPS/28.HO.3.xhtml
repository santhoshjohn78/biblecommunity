<h2>Hosea 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah said unto me, Go again, love a woman beloved of a friend, and an adulteress, according to the love of Jehovah for the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love raisin-cakes. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> So I bought her to me for fifteen silver pieces, and for a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley. <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be another man's, and I will also be for thee. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without statue, and without ephod and teraphim. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Afterwards shall the children of Israel return, and seek Jehovah their God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> and David their king; and shall turn with fear toward Jehovah and toward his goodness, at the end of the days.</p>
