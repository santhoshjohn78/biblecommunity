<h2>Deuteronomy 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> At the end of seven years thou shalt make a release, <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and this is the manner of the release: Every creditor shall relax his hand from the loan which he hath lent unto his neighbour; he shall not demand it of his neighbour, or of his brother; for a release to Jehovah hath been proclaimed. <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Of the foreigner thou mayest demand it; but what is thine with thy brother thy hand shall release; <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> save when there shall be no one in need among you; for Jehovah will greatly bless thee in the land that Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> if thou only diligently hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> to take heed to do all this commandment which I command thee this day. <a id="c15_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> will bless thee, as he promised thee; and thou shalt lend on pledge to many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over thee. <a id="c15_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> If there be amongst you a poor man, any one of thy brethren in one of thy gates, in thy land which Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy brother in need; <a id="c15_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> but thou shalt open thy hand bountifully unto him, and shalt certainly lend him on pledge what is sufficient for his need, in that which he lacketh. <a id="c15_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Beware that there be not a wicked thought in thy heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry against thee to Jehovah, and it be sin in thee. <a id="c15_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Thou shalt bountifully give unto him, and thy heart shall not be evil-disposed when thou givest unto him; because for this thing Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> will bless thee in all thy works, and in all the business of thy hand. <a id="c15_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For the needy shall never cease from within the land; therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thy hand bountifully unto thy brother, to thy poor and to thy needy, in thy land.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> If thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, have been sold unto thee, he shall serve thee six years, and in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee. <a id="c15_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty; <a id="c15_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> thou shalt certainly furnish him from thy sheep, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of what Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> hath blessed thee with shalt thou give unto him. <a id="c15_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and that Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> redeemed thee; therefore I command thee this thing to-day. <a id="c15_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee, --because he loveth thee and thy house, because he is well with thee, -- <a id="c15_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear and into the door; and he shall be thy bondman for ever. And also unto thy handmaid thou shalt do likewise. <a id="c15_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Let it not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for double the worth of a hired servant hath he been to thee, in serving thee six years; and Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> will bless thee in all that thou doest.</p>

<p><a id="c15_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Every firstling that is born among thy kine and among thy sheep that is a male, thou shalt hallow to Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a> thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy kine, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep. <a id="c15_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Thou shalt eat it before Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote10">*</a> year by year, in the place which Jehovah will choose, thou and thy household. <a id="c15_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> But if there be a defect therein, if it be lame, or blind, or have any evil defect, thou shalt not sacrifice it to Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote11">*</a>  <a id="c15_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> In thy gates shalt thou eat it; the unclean and the clean shall eat it alike, as the gazelle and as the hart. <a id="c15_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof: thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.</p>
