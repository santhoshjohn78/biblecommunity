<h2>Psalms 40</h2>

<p><a id="c40_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I waited patiently for Jehovah; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. <a id="c40_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he brought me up out of the pit of destruction, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock; he hath established my goings: <a id="c40_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And he hath put a new song in my mouth, praise unto our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> Many shall see it, and fear, and shall confide in Jehovah. <a id="c40_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Blessed is the man that hath made Jehovah his confidence, and turneth not to the proud, and to such as turn aside to lies. <a id="c40_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thou, O Jehovah my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> hast multiplied thy marvellous works, and thy thoughts toward us: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee; would I declare and speak them, they are more than can be numbered.</p>

<p><a id="c40_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire: ears hast thou prepared me. Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not demanded; <a id="c40_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Then said I, Behold, I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me-- <a id="c40_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> To do thy good pleasure, my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> is my delight, and thy law is within my heart. <a id="c40_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I have published righteousness in the great congregation: behold, I have not withheld my lips, Jehovah, thou knowest. <a id="c40_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> I have not hidden thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy loving-kindness and thy truth from the great congregation.</p>

<p><a id="c40_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Withhold not thou, Jehovah, thy tender mercies from me; let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me. <a id="c40_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I cannot see; they are more than the hairs of my head: and my heart hath failed me. <a id="c40_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me; Jehovah, make haste to my help. <a id="c40_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be turned backward and confounded that take pleasure in mine adversity; <a id="c40_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Let them be desolate, because of their shame, that say unto me, Aha! Aha! <a id="c40_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Let all those that seek thee be glad and rejoice in thee; let such as love thy salvation say continually, Jehovah be magnified! <a id="c40_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> But I am afflicted and needy: the Lord thinketh upon me. Thou art my help and my deliverer: my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> make no delay.</p>
