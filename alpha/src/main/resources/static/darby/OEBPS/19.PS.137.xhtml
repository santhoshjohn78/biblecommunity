<h2>Psalms 137</h2>

<p><a id="c137_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down; yea, we wept when we remembered Zion. <a id="c137_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. <a id="c137_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that made us wail required mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. <a id="c137_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> How should we sing a song of Jehovah's upon a foreign soil? <a id="c137_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> If I forget thee, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill; <a id="c137_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to my palate: if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.</p>

<p><a id="c137_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Remember, O Jehovah, against the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem; who said, Lay it bare, Lay it bare, down to its foundation! <a id="c137_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Daughter of Babylon, who art to be laid waste, happy he that rendereth unto thee that which thou hast meted out to us. <a id="c137_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Happy he that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the rock.</p>
