<h2>Proverbs 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> My son, if thou receivest my words, and layest up my commandments with thee, <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and thou apply thy heart to understanding; <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> yea, if thou criest after discernment and liftest up thy voice to understanding; <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hidden treasures: <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, and find the knowledge of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a>  <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For Jehovah giveth wisdom; out of his mouth come knowledge and understanding. <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to them that walk in integrity; <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> guarding the paths of just judgment and keeping the way of his godly ones. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity: every good path.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> When wisdom entereth into thy heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul, <a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> discretion shall keep thee, understanding shall preserve thee: <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the man that speaketh froward things; <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> from those who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of evil; <a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> whose paths are crooked, and who are perverted in their course: <a id="c2_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> To deliver thee from the strange woman, from the stranger who flattereth with her words; <a id="c2_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a>  <a id="c2_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> --for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead; <a id="c2_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> none that go unto her return again, neither do they attain to the paths of life: <a id="c2_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> --that thou mayest walk in the way of the good, and keep the paths of the righteous. <a id="c2_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it; <a id="c2_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> but the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful shall be plucked up out of it.</p>
