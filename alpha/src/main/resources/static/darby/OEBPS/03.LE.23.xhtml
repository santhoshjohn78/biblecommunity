<h2>Leviticus 23</h2>

<p><a id="c23_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, <a id="c23_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim as holy convocations--these are my set feasts. <a id="c23_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, a holy convocation; no manner of work shall ye do: it is the sabbath to Jehovah in all your dwellings.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> These are the set feasts of Jehovah, holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons: <a id="c23_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> In the first month, on the fourteenth of the month, between the two evenings, is the passover to Jehovah. <a id="c23_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And on the fifteenth day of this month is the feast of unleavened bread to Jehovah; seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread. <a id="c23_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> On the first day ye shall have a holy convocation: no manner of servile work shall ye do. <a id="c23_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And ye shall present to Jehovah an offering by fire seven days; on the seventh day is a holy convocation: no manner of servile work shall ye do. <a id="c23_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, <a id="c23_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them, When ye come into the land that I give unto you, and ye reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest. <a id="c23_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah, to be accepted for you; on the next day after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. <a id="c23_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf, a he-lamb without blemish, a yearling, for a burnt-offering to Jehovah; <a id="c23_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and the oblation thereof: two tenths of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering by fire to Jehovah for a sweet odour; and the drink-offering thereof, of wine, a fourth part of a hin. <a id="c23_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And ye shall not eat bread, or roast corn, or green ears, until the same day that ye have brought the offering of your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> it is an everlasting statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</p>

<p><a id="c23_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And ye shall count from the morning after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering, seven weeks; they shall be complete; <a id="c23_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> even unto the morning after the seventh sabbath shall ye count fifty days; and ye shall present a new oblation to Jehovah. <a id="c23_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Out of your dwellings shall ye bring two wave-loaves, of two tenths of fine flour; with leaven shall they be baken; as first-fruits to Jehovah. <a id="c23_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And ye shall present with the bread seven he-lambs without blemish, yearlings, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt-offering to Jehovah with their oblation, and their drink-offerings, an offering by fire of a sweet odour to Jehovah. <a id="c23_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And ye shall sacrifice one buck of the goats for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs, yearlings, for a sacrifice of peace-offering. <a id="c23_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits as a wave-offering before Jehovah, with the two he-lambs; they shall be holy to Jehovah, for the priest. <a id="c23_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And ye shall make proclamation on that same day--a holy convocation shall it be unto you: no manner of servile work shall ye do: it is an everlasting statute in all your dwellings throughout your generations. <a id="c23_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not in thy harvest entirely reap the corners of thy field, and the gleaning of thy harvest shalt thou not gather: thou shalt leave them unto the poor and to the stranger: I am Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a></p>

<p><a id="c23_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, <a id="c23_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first of the month, shall ye have a rest, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation. <a id="c23_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> No manner of servile work shall ye do; and ye shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah. <a id="c23_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, <a id="c23_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Also on the tenth of this seventh month is the day of the atonement: a holy convocation shall it be unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and present an offering by fire to Jehovah. <a id="c23_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And ye shall do no manner of work on that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a>  <a id="c23_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> For every soul that is not afflicted on that same day, shall be cut off from among his peoples. <a id="c23_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And every soul that doeth any manner of work on that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people. <a id="c23_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> No manner of work shall ye do: it is an everlasting statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings. <a id="c23_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> A sabbath of rest shall it be unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls.
