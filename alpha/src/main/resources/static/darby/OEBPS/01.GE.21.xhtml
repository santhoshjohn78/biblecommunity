<h2>Genesis 21</h2>

<p><a id="c21_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did to Sarah as he had spoken. <a id="c21_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the appointed time of which God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> had spoken to him. <a id="c21_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. <a id="c21_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> had commanded him. <a id="c21_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. <a id="c21_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Sarah said, God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> has made me laugh: all that hear will laugh with me. <a id="c21_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, Sarah will suckle children? For I have borne him a son in his old age. <a id="c21_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.</p>

<p><a id="c21_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking. <a id="c21_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And she said to Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son--with Isaac. <a id="c21_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. <a id="c21_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy handmaid: in all that Sarah hath said to thee hearken to her voice, for in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee. <a id="c21_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But also the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.</p>

<p><a id="c21_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a flask of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder--and the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. <a id="c21_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the water was exhausted from the flask; and she cast the child under one of the shrubs, <a id="c21_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and she went and sat down over against him, a bow-shot off; for she said, Let me not behold the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice and wept. <a id="c21_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> heard the voice of the lad. And the Angel of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> called to Hagar from the heavens, and said to her, What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not; for God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> hath heard the voice of the lad there, where he is. <a id="c21_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Arise, take the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for I will make of him a great nation. <a id="c21_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the flask with water, and gave the lad drink. <a id="c21_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a> was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. <a id="c21_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p><a id="c21_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech, and Phichol the captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote10">*</a> is with thee in all that thou doest. <a id="c21_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And now swear to me here by God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote11">*</a> that thou wilt not deal deceitfully with me, nor with my son, nor with my grandson. According to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou sojournest. <a id="c21_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Abraham said, I will swear. <a id="c21_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water that Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. <a id="c21_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this, neither hast thou told me of it, neither have I heard of it but to-day. <a id="c21_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. <a id="c21_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves. <a id="c21_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Abimelech said to Abraham, What mean these seven ewe-lambs, these which thou hast set by themselves? <a id="c21_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And he said, That thou take the seven ewe-lambs of my hand, that they may be a witness to me that I have dug this well. <a id="c21_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba, because there they had sworn, both of them. <a id="c21_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the captain of his host, and returned into the land of the Philistines.</p>

<p><a id="c21_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And Abraham planted a tamarisk in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the Eternal Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote12">*</a>  <a id="c21_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.</p>
