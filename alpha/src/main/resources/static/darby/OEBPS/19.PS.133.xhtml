<h2>Psalms 133</h2>

<p><a id="c133_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! <a id="c133_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, upon Aaron's beard, that ran down to the hem of his garments; <a id="c133_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> As the dew of Hermon that descendeth on the mountains of Zion; for there hath Jehovah commanded the blessing, life for evermore.</p>
