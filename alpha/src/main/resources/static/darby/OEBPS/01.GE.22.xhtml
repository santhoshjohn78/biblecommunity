<h2>Genesis 22</h2>

<p><a id="c22_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass after these things, that God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> tried Abraham, and said to him, Abraham! and he said, Here am I. <a id="c22_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and there offer him up for a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up and went to the place that God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> had told him of. <a id="c22_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar. <a id="c22_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Abraham said to his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. <a id="c22_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and the knife, and they went both of them together. <a id="c22_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father! And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the sheep for a burnt-offering? <a id="c22_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And Abraham said, My son, God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> will provide himself with the sheep for a burnt-offering. And they went both of them together. <a id="c22_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And they came to the place of which God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> had told him. And Abraham built the altar there, and piled the wood; and he bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. <a id="c22_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to slaughter his son.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens, and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, Here am I. <a id="c22_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And he said, Stretch not out thy hand against the lad, neither do anything to him; for now I know that thou fearest God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me. <a id="c22_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind was a ram caught in the thicket by its horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt-offering instead of his son. <a id="c22_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh; as it is said at the present day, On the mount of Jehovah will be provided.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the Angel of Jehovah called to Abraham from the heavens a second time, <a id="c22_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and said, By myself I swear, saith Jehovah, that, because thou hast done this, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, <a id="c22_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> I will richly bless thee, and greatly multiply thy seed, as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is on the sea-shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; <a id="c22_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves, because thou hast hearkened to my voice. <a id="c22_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.</p>

<p><a id="c22_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also has borne sons to thy brother Nahor: <a id="c22_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, <a id="c22_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. <a id="c22_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> (And Bethuel begot Rebecca.) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother. <a id="c22_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And his concubine, named Reumah, she also bore Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maacah.</p>
