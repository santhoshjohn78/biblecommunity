<h2>Ezekiel 7</h2>

<p><a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, <a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto the land of Israel: An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land. <a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Now is the end upon thee; and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will bring upon thee all thine abominations. <a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. <a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an only evil! behold, it is come. <a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The end is come, the end is come; it awaketh against thee: behold, it cometh. <a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> The doom is come unto thee, inhabitant of the land; the time is come, the day is near, --tumult, and not the joyous cry from the mountains. <a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Now will I soon pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee; and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will bring upon thee all thine abominations. <a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will render unto thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that it is I, Jehovah, that smite. <a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Behold the day, behold, it is come: the doom is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride is full blown. <a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: nothing of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth, nor of the magnificence in the midst of them. <a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for fierce anger is upon all the multitude thereof. <a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, even though he were yet alive amongst the living: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof; it shall not be revoked; and none shall through his iniquity assure his life. <a id="c7_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> They have blown the trumpet and made all ready, but none goeth to the battle; for my fierce anger is upon all the multitude thereof. <a id="c7_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die by the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one for his iniquity. <a id="c7_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall melt into water. <a id="c7_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And they shall gird on sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads. <a id="c7_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an impurity: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah's wrath; they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their belly; for it hath been the stumbling-block of their iniquity. <a id="c7_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And he set in majesty his beautiful ornament; but they made therein the images of their abominations and of their detestable things: therefore have I made it an impurity unto them. <a id="c7_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And I will give it into the hands of strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it. <a id="c7_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And I will turn my face from them; and they shall profane my secret place; and the violent shall enter into it, and profane it.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence. <a id="c7_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Therefore will I bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses; and I will make the pride of the strong to cease; and their sanctuaries shall be profaned. <a id="c7_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, but there shall be none. <a id="c7_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; and they shall seek a vision from a prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders. <a id="c7_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with dismay, and the hands of the people of the land shall tremble: I will do unto them according to their way, and with their judgments will I judge them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</p>
