<h2>Micah 7</h2>

<p><a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer-fruits, as the grape-gleanings of the vintage. There is no cluster to eat; there is no early fruit which my soul desired. <a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The godly man hath perished out of the land, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood, they hunt every man his brother with a net. <a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Both hands are for evil, to do it well. The prince asketh, and the judge is there for a reward; and the great man uttereth his soul's greed: and together they combine it. <a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The best of them is as a briar; the most upright, worse than a thorn-fence. The day of thy watchmen, thy visitation is come; now shall be their perplexity. <a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Believe ye not in a companion, put not confidence in a familiar friend: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. <a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law: a man's enemies are the men of his own household.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But as for me, I will look unto Jehovah; I will wait for the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of my salvation: my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> will hear me. <a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: though I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah shall be a light unto me. <a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> I will bear the indignation of Jehovah--for I have sinned against him--until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light; I shall behold his righteousness. <a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> Mine eyes shall behold her; now shall she be trodden down, as the mire of the streets. <a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> In the day when thy walls shall be built, on that day shall the established limit recede. <a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> In that day they shall come to thee from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain. <a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine inheritance, dwelling alone in the forest, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. <a id="c7_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> --As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt, will I shew them marvellous things. <a id="c7_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> --The nations shall see, and be ashamed for all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf. <a id="c7_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> They shall lick dust like the serpent; like crawling things of the earth, they shall come trembling forth from their close places. They shall turn with fear to Jehovah our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> and shall be afraid because of thee. <a id="c7_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Who is a Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> like unto thee, that forgiveth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in loving-kindness. <a id="c7_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> He will yet again have compassion on us, he will tread under foot our iniquities: and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. <a id="c7_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Thou wilt perform truth to Jacob, loving-kindness to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers, from the days of old.</p>
