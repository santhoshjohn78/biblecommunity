<h2>Exodus 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And these are the names of the sons of Israel who had come into Egypt; with Jacob had they come, each with his household: <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; <a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And all the souls that had come out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls; and Joseph was in Egypt. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the children of Israel were fruitful, and swarmed and multiplied, and became exceeding strong; and the land was full of them.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more numerous and stronger than we. <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Come on, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass that, if war occur, they take side with our enemies and fight against us, and go up out of the land. <a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And they set over them service-masters to oppress them with their burdens. And they built store-cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Rameses. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and spread; and they were distressed because of the children of Israel. <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with harshness; <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and they embittered their life with hard labour in clay and bricks, and in all manner of labour in the field: all their labour with which they made them serve was with harshness.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives--of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other was Puah-- <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and he said, When ye help the Hebrew women in bearing, and see them on the stool, if it be a son, then ye shall kill him, but if a daughter, then she shall live. <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> But the midwives feared God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> and did not as the king of Egypt had said to them, but saved the male children alive. <a id="c1_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them, Why have ye done this, and saved the male children alive? <a id="c1_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian; for they are strong, and they have borne before the midwife comes to them. <a id="c1_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and became very strong. <a id="c1_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> that he made them houses. <a id="c1_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Then Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, but every daughter ye shall save alive.</p>
