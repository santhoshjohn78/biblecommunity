<h2>Jonah 4</h2>

<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he prayed unto Jehovah, and said, Ah, Jehovah, was not this my saying when I was yet in my country? Therefore I was minded to flee at first unto Tarshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> and merciful, slow to anger, and of great loving-kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And now, Jehovah, take, I beseech thee, my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Jehovah said, Doest thou well to be angry?</p>

<p><a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Jehovah Elohim prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his trouble. And Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> But God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, so that he fainted; and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, unto death. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Jehovah said, Thou hast pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: <a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and I, should not I have pity on Nineveh, the great city, wherein are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?</p>
