<h2>Titus 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> But do thou speak the things that become sound teaching; <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> that the elder men be sober, grave, discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience; <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> that the elder women in like manner be in deportment as becoming those who have to say to sacred things, not slanderers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is right; <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> that they may admonish the young women to be attached to their husbands, to be attached to their children, <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> discreet, chaste, diligent in home work, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The younger men in like manner exhort to be discreet: <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> in all things affording thyself as a pattern of good works; in teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> a sound word, not to be condemned; that he who is opposed may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us: <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> bondmen to be subject to their own masters, to make themselves acceptable in everything; not gainsaying; <a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> not robbing their masters, but shewing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the teaching which is of our Saviour God in all things.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For the grace of God which carries with it salvation for all men has appeared, <a id="c2_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> teaching us that, having denied impiety and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and justly, and piously in the present course of things, <a id="c2_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> awaiting the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ; <a id="c2_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all lawlessness, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous for good works.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise thee.</p>
