<h2>Psalms 142</h2>

<p><a id="c142_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I cry unto Jehovah with my voice: with my voice unto Jehovah do I make supplication. <a id="c142_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I pour out my plaint before him; I shew before him my trouble. <a id="c142_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they hidden a snare for me.</p>

<p><a id="c142_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Look on the right hand and see; there is no man that knoweth me: refuge hath failed me; no man careth for my soul. <a id="c142_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I cried unto thee, Jehovah; I said, Thou art my refuge, my portion in the land of the living. <a id="c142_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Attend unto my cry, for I am brought very low; deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I. <a id="c142_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Bring my soul out of prison, that I may celebrate thy name. The righteous shall surround me, because thou dealest bountifully with me.</p>
