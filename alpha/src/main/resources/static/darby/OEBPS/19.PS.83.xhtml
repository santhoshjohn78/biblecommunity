<h2>Psalms 83</h2>

<p><a id="c83_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> keep not silence; hold not thy peace, and be not still, O Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a>  <a id="c83_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> For behold, thine enemies make a tumult; and they that hate thee lift up the head. <a id="c83_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> They take crafty counsel against thy people, and consult against thy hidden ones: <a id="c83_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> They say, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, and let the name of Israel be mentioned no more. <a id="c83_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> For they have consulted together with one heart: they have made an alliance together against thee. <a id="c83_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagarites; <a id="c83_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia, with the inhabitants of Tyre; <a id="c83_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Asshur also is joined with them: they are an arm to the sons of Lot. Selah.</p>

<p><a id="c83_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Do unto them as to Midian; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the torrent of Kishon: <a id="c83_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Who were destroyed at Endor; they became as dung for the ground. <a id="c83_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb; and all their chiefs as Zebah and as Zalmunna. <a id="c83_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For they have said, Let us take to ourselves God's<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> dwelling-places in possession. <a id="c83_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> O my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> make them like a whirling thing, like stubble before the wind. <a id="c83_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> As fire burneth a forest, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire, <a id="c83_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> So pursue them with thy tempest, and terrify them with thy whirlwind. <a id="c83_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek thy name, O Jehovah. <a id="c83_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Let them be put to shame and be dismayed for ever, and let them be confounded and perish: <a id="c83_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> That they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah, art the Most High over all the earth.</p>
