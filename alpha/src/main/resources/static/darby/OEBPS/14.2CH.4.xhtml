<p><a id="c4_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And he made a brazen altar: its length was twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits, and its height ten cubits. <a id="c4_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he made the sea, molten, ten cubits from brim to brim, round all about; and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it round about. <a id="c4_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And under it was the similitude of oxen, encompassing it round about, ten in a cubit enclosing the sea round about, two rows of oxen, cast when it was cast. <a id="c4_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward. <a id="c4_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And its thickness was a hand-breadth, and its brim like the work of the brim of a cup, with lily-blossoms; in capacity it held three thousand baths. <a id="c4_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he made ten lavers, and put five on the right and five on the left, to wash in them: they rinsed in them what they prepared for the burnt-offering; and the sea was for the priests to wash in. <a id="c4_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance respecting them, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand and five on the left. <a id="c4_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right hand and five on the left. And he made a hundred golden bowls. <a id="c4_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors thereof with bronze. <a id="c4_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he set the sea on the right side eastward, over against the south.</p>

<p><a id="c4_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls. So Huram ended doing the work that he made for king Solomon in the house of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a>  <a id="c4_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> two pillars, and the globes and the capitals on the top of the pillars, two; and the two networks, to cover the two globes of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; <a id="c4_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two globes of the capitals which were upon the pillars. <a id="c4_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And he made the bases, and he made the lavers on the bases; <a id="c4_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> one sea, and the twelve oxen under it. <a id="c4_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the pots, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their instruments did Huram Abiv make king Solomon for the house of Jehovah, of bright brass. <a id="c4_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay-ground between Succoth and Zeredathah. <a id="c4_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Solomon made all these vessels in great number; for the weight of the brass was not ascertained. <a id="c4_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> the golden altar; and the tables whereon was the shewbread; <a id="c4_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and the candlesticks with their lamps to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold; <a id="c4_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold (it was perfect gold); <a id="c4_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> and the knives, and the bowls, and the cups, and the censers, of pure gold; and the entrance of the house, the inner folding-doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house, of the temple, of gold.</p>
