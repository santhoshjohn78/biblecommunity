<h2>Psalms 15</h2>

<p><a id="c15_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tent? who shall dwell in the hill of thy holiness? <a id="c15_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth from his heart. <a id="c15_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He that slandereth not with his tongue, doeth not evil to his companion, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour; <a id="c15_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> In whose eyes the depraved person is contemned, and who honoureth them that fear Jehovah; who, if he have sworn to his own hurt, changeth it not; <a id="c15_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.</p>
