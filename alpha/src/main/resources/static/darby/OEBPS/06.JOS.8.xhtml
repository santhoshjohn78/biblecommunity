<h2>Joshua 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be dismayed. Take with thee all the people of war, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land. <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And thou shalt do to Ai and to its king as thou didst to Jericho and to its king; only, the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye take as prey for yourselves. Set an ambush against the city behind it.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose thirty thousand valiant men, and sent them away by night. <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he commanded them, saying, See, ye shall be in ambush against the city, behind the city: go not very far from the city, and be all of you ready. <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And I and all the people that are with me will approach to the city; and it shall come to pass when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them. <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first; and we will flee before them. <a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And ye shall rise up from the ambush and take possession of the city; and Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> will deliver it into your hand. <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And it shall be when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of Jehovah shall ye do. See, I have commanded you. <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west of Ai. And Joshua lodged that night among the people. <a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Joshua rose early in the morning, and inspected the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. <a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And all the people of war that were with him went up, and drew near, and came before the city; and they encamped on the north of Ai; and the valley was between them and Ai. <a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Now he had taken about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west of the city. <a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And when they had set the people, the whole camp on the north of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley. <a id="c8_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And it came to pass when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hasted and rose early, and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the appointed place before the plain. But he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city. <a id="c8_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Joshua and all Israel let themselves be beaten before them; and they fled by the way of the wilderness. <a id="c8_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them; and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. <a id="c8_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And not a man remained in Ai and Bethel that went not out after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel. <a id="c8_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Jehovah said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that he had in his hand toward the city. <a id="c8_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And the ambush arose quickly from their place, and they ran when he stretched out his hand, and came into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire. <a id="c8_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And the men of Ai turned and saw, and behold, the smoke of the city went up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way; and the people that fled to the wilderness turned upon the pursuers. <a id="c8_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, they turned again, and slew the men of Ai. <a id="c8_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And the others went out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and they smote them, until they let none of them escape or flee away.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua. <a id="c8_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And it came to pass when Israel had ended slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they had chased them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. <a id="c8_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And so it was, that all who fell that day, men as well as women, were twelve thousand, all the people of Ai. <a id="c8_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Joshua did not draw back his hand, which he had stretched out with the javelin, until they had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. <a id="c8_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Only, the cattle and the spoil of the city Israel took as prey to themselves, according to the word of Jehovah which he had commanded Joshua. <a id="c8_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And Joshua burned Ai, and made it an everlasting heap of desolation to this day. <a id="c8_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the evening; and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his carcase down from the tree, and threw it down at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised upon it a great heap of stones, which remains to this day.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Then Joshua built an altar to Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of Israel, in mount Ebal, <a id="c8_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which iron had not been lifted up. And they offered up burnt-offerings on it to Jehovah, and sacrificed peace-offerings. <a id="c8_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written before the children of Israel. <a id="c8_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> And all Israel, and their elders, and their officers and judges, stood on this side and on that side of the ark before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as well the stranger as the home-born Israelite; half of them toward mount Gerizim, and the other half of them toward mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded, that they should bless the people of Israel, in the beginning. <a id="c8_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And afterwards he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law. <a id="c8_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua read not before the whole congregation of Israel, and the women, and the children, and the strangers that lived among them.</p>
