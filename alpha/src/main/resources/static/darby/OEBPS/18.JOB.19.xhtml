<h2>Job 19</h2>

<p><a id="c19_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Job answered and said, <a id="c19_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> How long will ye vex my soul, and crush me with words? <a id="c19_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> These ten times have ye reproached me; ye are not ashamed to stupefy me. <a id="c19_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And be it that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself. <a id="c19_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and prove against me my reproach, <a id="c19_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Know now that +God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> hath overthrown me, and hath surrounded me with his net. <a id="c19_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Behold, I cry out of wrong, and I am not heard; I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> He hath hedged up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths. <a id="c19_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. <a id="c19_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> He breaketh me down on every side, and I am gone; and my hope hath he torn up as a tree. <a id="c19_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And he hath kindled his anger against me, and hath counted me unto him as one of his enemies. <a id="c19_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> His troops have come together and cast up their way against me, and have encamped round about my tent. <a id="c19_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are quite estranged from me. <a id="c19_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> My kinsfolk have failed, and my known friends have forgotten me. <a id="c19_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> The sojourners in my house and my maids count me as a stranger; I am an alien in their sight. <a id="c19_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> I called my servant, and he answered not; I entreated him with my mouth. <a id="c19_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> My breath is strange to my wife, and my entreaties to the children of my mother's womb. <a id="c19_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Even young children despise me; I rise up, and they speak against me. <a id="c19_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> All my intimate friends abhor me, and they whom I loved are turned against me. <a id="c19_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> My bones cleave to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. <a id="c19_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, ye my friends; for the hand of +God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> hath touched me. <a id="c19_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Why do ye persecute me as Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> and are not satisfied with my flesh?</p>

<p><a id="c19_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> Oh would that my words were written! oh that they were inscribed in a book! <a id="c19_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> That with an iron style and lead they were graven in the rock for ever! <a id="c19_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And as for me, I know that my Redeemer liveth, and the Last, he shall stand upon the earth; <a id="c19_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And if after my skin this shall be destroyed, yet from out of my flesh shall I see +God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a>  <a id="c19_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another: --my reins are consumed within me. <a id="c19_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> If ye say, How shall we persecute him? when the root of the matter is found in me, <a id="c19_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Be ye yourselves afraid of the sword! for the sword is fury against misdeeds, that ye may know there is a judgment.</p>
