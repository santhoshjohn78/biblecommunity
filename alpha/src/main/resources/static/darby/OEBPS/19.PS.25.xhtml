<h2>Psalms 25</h2>

<p><a id="c25_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Unto thee, Jehovah, do I lift up my soul. <a id="c25_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> My God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> I confide in thee; let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me. <a id="c25_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Yea, none that wait on thee shall be ashamed: they shall be ashamed that deal treacherously without cause. <a id="c25_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Make me to know thy ways, O Jehovah; teach me thy paths. <a id="c25_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Make me to walk in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day. <a id="c25_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Remember, Jehovah, thy tender mercies and thy loving-kindnesses; for they are from everlasting. <a id="c25_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions; according to thy loving-kindness remember thou me, for thy goodness' sake, Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Good and upright is Jehovah; therefore will he instruct sinners in the way: <a id="c25_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way. <a id="c25_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> All the paths of Jehovah are loving-kindness and truth for such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. <a id="c25_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For thy name's sake, O Jehovah, thou wilt indeed pardon mine iniquity; for it is great. <a id="c25_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> What man is he that feareth Jehovah? him will he instruct in the way that he should choose. <a id="c25_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> His soul shall dwell in prosperity, and his seed shall inherit the earth. <a id="c25_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> The secret of Jehovah is with them that fear him, that he may make known his covenant to them.</p>

<p><a id="c25_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Mine eyes are ever toward Jehovah; for he will bring my feet out of the net. <a id="c25_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Turn toward me, and be gracious unto me; for I am solitary and afflicted. <a id="c25_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The troubles of my heart are increased: bring me out of my distresses; <a id="c25_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> Consider mine affliction and my travail, and forgive all my sins. <a id="c25_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Consider mine enemies, for they are many, and they hate me with cruel hatred. <a id="c25_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I trust in thee. <a id="c25_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee. <a id="c25_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Redeem Israel, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> out of all his troubles.</p>
