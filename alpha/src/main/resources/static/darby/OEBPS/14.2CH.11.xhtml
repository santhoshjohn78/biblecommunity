<h2>2 Chronicles 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Rehoboam came to Jerusalem; and he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men apt for war, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam. <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> saying, <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Thus saith Jehovah: Go not up, nor fight with your brethren; return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. And they hearkened to the words of Jehovah, and returned from going against Jeroboam. <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah. <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam, <a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, <a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, <a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and Zorah, and Ajalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities. <a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and of oil and wine; <a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and in every several city, targets and spears, and made them exceedingly strong. And Judah and Benjamin were his.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their districts; <a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> for the Levites left their suburbs and their possessions, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from exercising the priesthood to Jehovah; <a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> and he ordained for himself priests for the high places, and for the he-goats and for the calves that he had made. <a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> --And after them, those out of all the tribes of Israel that set their heart to seek Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> of their fathers. <a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong three years; for during three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon. <a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Rehoboam took Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David as wife, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse. <a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And she bore him children: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham. <a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith. <a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines; for he had taken eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and he begot twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. <a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Rehoboam established Abijah the son of Maachah at the head, to be ruler among his brethren; for he thought to make him king. <a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to all the fortified cities; and he gave them food in abundance. And he desired for them a multitude of wives.</p>
