<h2>1 Chronicles 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And it came to pass as David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedars, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah under curtains. <a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> is with thee. <a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And it came to pass that night that the word of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> came to Nathan saying, <a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Go and say to David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in; <a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day; but I have been from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another. <a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> In all my going about with all Israel, did I speak a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why build ye me not a house of cedars? <a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And now, thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I took thee from the pasture-grounds, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel; <a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name, like unto the name of the great men that are on the earth. <a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and be disturbed no more; neither shall the sons of wickedness waste them any more, as formerly, <a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and since the days that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. And I will subdue all thine enemies; and I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house. <a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. <a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> It is he who shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. <a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> I will be his father, and he shall be my son; and I will not take away my mercy from him, as I took it from him that was before thee; <a id="c17_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> and I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever. <a id="c17_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And king David went in and sat before Jehovah, and said, Who am I, Jehovah Elohim, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? <a id="c17_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And this hath been a small thing in thy sight, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> and thou hast spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the rank of a man of high degree, Jehovah Elohim. <a id="c17_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> What can David say more to thee for the glory of thy servant? thou indeed knowest thy servant. <a id="c17_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Jehovah, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, to make known all these great things. <a id="c17_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. <a id="c17_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And who is like thy people Israel, the one nation in the earth that God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> went to redeem to be a people to himself, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, which thou hast redeemed out of Egypt? <a id="c17_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And thy people Israel hast thou made thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, art become their God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a>  <a id="c17_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And now, Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said. <a id="c17_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Let it even be established, and let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> of Israel, is God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> to Israel; and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee. <a id="c17_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> For thou, my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a> hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house; therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray before thee. <a id="c17_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And now, Jehovah, thou art that God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote10">*</a> and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant; <a id="c17_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and now, let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever; for thou, Jehovah, hast blessed it, and it shall be blessed for ever.</p>
