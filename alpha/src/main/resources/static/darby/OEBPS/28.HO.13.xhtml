<h2>Hosea 13</h2>

<p><a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; he exalted himself in Israel: but he trespassed through Baal, and he died. <a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves. <a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing-floor, and as the smoke out of the lattice. <a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Yet I am Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> from the land of Egypt, and thou hast known no God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> but me; and there is no saviour besides me.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> I knew thee in the wilderness, in the land of drought. <a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> According to their pasture, they became full; they became full, and their heart was exalted: therefore have they forgotten me. <a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I will be unto them as a lion; as a leopard I will lurk for them by the way; <a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> I will meet them as a bear bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the covering of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lioness: the beast of the field shall tear them.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> It is thy destruction, O Israel, that thou art against me, against thy help. <a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Where then is thy king, that he may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes? -- <a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath. <a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is laid by in store. <a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> The pangs of a woman in travail shall come upon him: he is a son not wise; for at the time of the breaking forth of children, he was not there. <a id="c13_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> I will ransom them from the power of Sheol. I will redeem them from death: where, O death, are thy plagues? where, O Sheol, is thy destruction? Repentance shall be hid from mine eyes. <a id="c13_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, a wind of Jehovah that cometh up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels. <a id="c13_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Samaria shall bear her guilt; for she hath rebelled against her God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> they shall fall by the sword; their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.</p>
