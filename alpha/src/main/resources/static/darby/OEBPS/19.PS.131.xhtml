<h2>Psalms 131</h2>

<p><a id="c131_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither do I exercise myself in great matters, and in things too wonderful for me. <a id="c131_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Surely I have restrained and composed my soul, like a weaned child with its mother: my soul within me is as a weaned child. <a id="c131_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Let Israel hope in Jehovah, from henceforth and for evermore.</p>
