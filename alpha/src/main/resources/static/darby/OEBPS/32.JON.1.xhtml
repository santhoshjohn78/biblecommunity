<h2>Jonah 1</h2>

<p><a id="c1_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, <a id="c1_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me. <a id="c1_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish, from the presence of Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> But Jehovah sent out a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest upon the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. <a id="c1_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the mariners were afraid, and cried every one unto his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to be lightened of them. But Jonah had gone down into the lower part of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. <a id="c1_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, sleeper? arise, call upon thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> perhaps God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> will think upon us, that we perish not. <a id="c1_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And they said each one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. <a id="c1_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And they said unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us: what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou? <a id="c1_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he said unto them, I am a Hebrew, and I fear Jehovah, the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> of the heavens, who hath made the sea and the dry land. <a id="c1_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, What is this thou hast done? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of Jehovah: for he had told them.</p>

<p><a id="c1_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And they said unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous. <a id="c1_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that because of me this great tempest is upon you. <a id="c1_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But the men rowed hard to regain the land; but they could not; for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them. <a id="c1_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And they cried unto Jehovah and said, Ah, Jehovah, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, Jehovah, hast done as it pleased thee. <a id="c1_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from its raging. <a id="c1_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the men feared Jehovah exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto Jehovah, and made vows. <a id="c1_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</p>
