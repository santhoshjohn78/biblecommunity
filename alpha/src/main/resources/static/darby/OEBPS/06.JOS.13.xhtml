<h2>Joshua 13</h2>

<p><a id="c13_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Joshua was old, advanced in age, and Jehovah said to him, Thou art old, advanced in age, and there remaineth yet very much land to take possession of. <a id="c13_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> This is the land that yet remaineth: all the districts of the Philistines and all the Geshurites, <a id="c13_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> from the Shihor, which floweth before Egypt, as far as the borders of Ekron northward, and which is counted to the Canaanite; five lordships of the Philistines: of Gazah, and of Ashdod, of Eshkalon, of Gath, and of Ekron; also the Avvites; <a id="c13_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> in the south, the whole land of the Canaanites, and Mearah which belongeth to the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the border of the Amorites; <a id="c13_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sun-rising, from Baal-Gad at the foot of mount Hermon to the entrance into Hamath; <a id="c13_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> all the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, all the Sidonians; I will dispossess them from before the children of Israel. Only, partition it by lot to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.</p>

<p><a id="c13_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And now divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and to half the tribe of Manasseh; <a id="c13_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> with him the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them: <a id="c13_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> from Aroer, which is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the ravine, and all the plateau of Medeba to Dibon, <a id="c13_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and all the cities of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who reigned at Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon; <a id="c13_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and the whole of Bashan to Salcah; <a id="c13_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, who remained of the residue of the giants; and Moses smote them and dispossessed them. <a id="c13_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> But the children of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites nor the Maachathites; but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites to this day. <a id="c13_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance: the offerings by fire of Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of Israel are their inheritance, as he said to them. <a id="c13_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Moses gave a portion to the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families. <a id="c13_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And their territory was from Aroer, which is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the ravine, and all the plateau by Medeba; <a id="c13_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plateau, Dibon, and Bamoth-Baal, and Beth-Baal-meon, <a id="c13_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Jahzah, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath, <a id="c13_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> and Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar in the mountain of the vale, <a id="c13_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and Beth-Peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth; <a id="c13_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> all the cities of the plateau, and the whole kingdom of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who reigned at Heshbon, whom Moses smote, him and the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the chiefs of Sihon dwelling in the land. <a id="c13_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner, did the children of Israel kill with the sword among them that were slain by them. <a id="c13_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And the border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and its border. This is the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and their hamlets. <a id="c13_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Moses gave a portion to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad according to their families. <a id="c13_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And their territory was Jaazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer which is before Rabbah; <a id="c13_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and from Heshbon to Ramath-Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir; <a id="c13_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and in the valley, Beth-haram, and Beth-Nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon the king of Heshbon, the Jordan and its border, as far as the edge of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward. <a id="c13_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and their hamlets. <a id="c13_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And Moses gave a portion to half the tribe of Manasseh; and for half the tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families: <a id="c13_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, the whole kingdom of Og the king of Bashan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities. <a id="c13_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, belonged to the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, to the one half of the children of Machir according to their families. <a id="c13_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> This is that which Moses allotted for inheritance in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan of Jericho, eastward. <a id="c13_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of Israel is their inheritance, as he said to them.</p>
