<h2>Ezra 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And when the seventh month came, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built the altar of the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> of Israel, to offer up burnt-offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a>  <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And they set the altar on its base; for fear was upon them because of the people of the countries; and they offered up burnt-offerings on it to Jehovah, the morning and evening burnt-offerings. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And they held the feast of tabernacles as it is written, and offered daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required; <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> and afterwards the continual burnt-offering, and those of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a voluntary offering to Jehovah. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer up burnt-offerings to Jehovah. But the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was not yet laid. <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And they gave money to the masons and to the carpenters; and meat and drink and oil to the Zidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And in the second year of their coming to the house of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and they appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to superintend the work of the house of Jehovah. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Jeshua stood up, his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, as one man, to superintend the workmen in the house of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> also the sons of Henadad, their sons and their brethren, the Levites. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel, with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise Jehovah according to the directions of David king of Israel. <a id="c3_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And they sang alternately together in praising and giving thanks to Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving-kindness endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout to the praise of Jehovah, because the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid. <a id="c3_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But many of the priests and Levites and chief fathers, the ancient men that had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice, when the foundation of this house was laid in their sight; and many shouted aloud for joy. <a id="c3_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a great shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</p>
