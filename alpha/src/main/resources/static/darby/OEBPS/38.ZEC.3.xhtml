<h2>Zechariah 3</h2>

<p><a id="c3_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. <a id="c3_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan! Yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee! Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire? <a id="c3_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the Angel. <a id="c3_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he spoke and said unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from off him. And unto him he said, See, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I clothe thee with festival-robes. <a id="c3_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And I said, Let them set a pure turban upon his head. And they set the pure turban upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the Angel of Jehovah stood by. <a id="c3_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the Angel of Jehovah protested unto Joshua, saying, <a id="c3_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts; and I will give thee a place to walk among these that stand by.</p>

<p><a id="c3_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Hear now, Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee--for they are men of portent--for behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch. <a id="c3_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> For behold, the stone that I have laid before Joshua--upon one stone are seven eyes; behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of this land in one day. <a id="c3_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, shall ye invite every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig-tree.</p>
