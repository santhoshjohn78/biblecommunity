<h2>Psalms 115</h2>

<p><a id="c115_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Not unto us, O Jehovah, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy loving-kindness and for thy truth's sake. <a id="c115_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Wherefore should the nations say, Where then is their God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a>  <a id="c115_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> But our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he pleased. <a id="c115_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands: <a id="c115_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> They have a mouth, and they speak not; eyes have they, and they see not; <a id="c115_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> They have ears, and they hear not; a nose have they, and they smell not; <a id="c115_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> They have hands, and they handle not; feet have they, and they walk not; they give no sound through their throat. <a id="c115_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> They that make them are like unto them, --every one that confideth in them.</p>

<p><a id="c115_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> O Israel, confide thou in Jehovah: he is their help and their shield. <a id="c115_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> House of Aaron, confide in Jehovah: he is their help and their shield. <a id="c115_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Ye that fear Jehovah, confide in Jehovah: he is their help and their shield. <a id="c115_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Jehovah hath been mindful of us: he will bless, he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron; <a id="c115_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He will bless them that fear Jehovah, both the small and the great. <a id="c115_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Jehovah will add unto you more, unto you and unto your children. <a id="c115_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Ye are blessed of Jehovah, who made the heavens and the earth. <a id="c115_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> The heavens are the heavens of Jehovah, but the earth hath he given to the children of men. <a id="c115_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> The dead praise not Jah, neither any that go down into silence; <a id="c115_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> But we will bless Jah from this time forth and for evermore. Hallelujah!</p>
