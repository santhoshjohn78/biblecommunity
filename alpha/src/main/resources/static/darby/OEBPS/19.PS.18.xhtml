<h2>Psalms 18</h2>

<p><a id="c18_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> I will love thee, O Jehovah, my strength. <a id="c18_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> my rock, in whom I will trust; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower. <a id="c18_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> I will call upon Jehovah, who is to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. <a id="c18_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The bands of death encompassed me, and torrents of Belial made me afraid. <a id="c18_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The bands of Sheol surrounded me, the cords of death encountered me. <a id="c18_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> In my distress I called upon Jehovah, and I cried out to my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, into his ears. <a id="c18_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains trembled and shook, because he was wroth. <a id="c18_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals burned forth from it. <a id="c18_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he bowed the heavens, and came down; and darkness was under his feet. <a id="c18_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he rode upon a cherub and did fly; yea, he flew fast upon the wings of the wind. <a id="c18_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> He made darkness his secret place, his tent round about him: darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies. <a id="c18_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> From the brightness before him his thick clouds passed forth: hail and coals of fire. <a id="c18_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Jehovah thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice: hail and coals of fire. <a id="c18_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And he sent his arrows, and scattered mine enemies; and he shot forth lightnings, and discomfited them. <a id="c18_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the beds of the waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were uncovered at thy rebuke, Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. <a id="c18_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> He reached forth from above, he took me, he drew me out of great waters: <a id="c18_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me; for they were mightier than I. <a id="c18_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> They encountered me in the day of my calamity, but Jehovah was my stay. <a id="c18_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And he brought me forth into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. <a id="c18_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, and have not wickedly departed from my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a>  <a id="c18_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For all his ordinances were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me; <a id="c18_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And I was upright with him, and kept myself from mine iniquity. <a id="c18_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Jehovah hath recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight. <a id="c18_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> With the gracious thou dost shew thyself gracious; with the upright man thou dost shew thyself upright; <a id="c18_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> With the pure thou dost shew thyself pure; and with the perverse thou dost shew thyself contrary. <a id="c18_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> For it is thou that savest the afflicted people; but the haughty eyes wilt thou bring down. <a id="c18_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> For it is thou that makest my lamp to shine: Jehovah my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> enlighteneth my darkness.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> have I leaped over a wall. <a id="c18_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> As for 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> his way is perfect; the word of Jehovah is tried: he is a shield to all that trust in him. <a id="c18_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> For who is +God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> save Jehovah? and who is a rock if not our God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a>  <a id="c18_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> The 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a> who girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect, <a id="c18_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Who maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places; <a id="c18_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Who teacheth my hands to war, and mine arms bend a bow of brass; <a id="c18_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And thou didst give me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand held me up; and thy condescending gentleness hath made me great. <a id="c18_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Thou didst enlarge my steps under me, and mine ankles have not wavered. <a id="c18_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> I pursued mine enemies, and overtook them; and I turned not again till they were consumed. <a id="c18_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> I crushed them, and they were not able to rise: they fell under my feet. <a id="c18_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And thou girdedst me with strength to battle; thou didst subdue under me those that rose up against me. <a id="c18_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And mine enemies didst thou make to turn their backs unto me, and those that hated me I destroyed. <a id="c18_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> They cried, and there was none to save; --unto Jehovah, and he answered them not. <a id="c18_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> And I did beat them small as dust before the wind; I did cast them out as the mire of the streets. <a id="c18_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; thou hast made me the head of the nations: a people I knew not doth serve me. <a id="c18_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> At the hearing of the ear, they obey me: strangers come cringing unto me. <a id="c18_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> Strangers have faded away, and they come trembling forth from their close places. <a id="c18_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote10">*</a> of my salvation, <a id="c18_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> The 路God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote11">*</a> who hath avenged me, and hath subjected the peoples to me; <a id="c18_v48"></a><span class="vn">48</span> Who hath delivered me from mine enemies: yea, thou hast lifted me up above them that rose up against me; from the man of violence hast thou delivered me. <a id="c18_v49"></a><span class="vn">49</span> Therefore will I give thanks to thee, Jehovah, among the nations, and will sing psalms to thy name. <a id="c18_v50"></a><span class="vn">50</span> It is he who giveth great deliverances to his king, and sheweth loving-kindness to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>
