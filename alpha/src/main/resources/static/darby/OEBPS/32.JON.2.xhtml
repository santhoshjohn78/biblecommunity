<h2>Jonah 2</h2>

<p><a id="c2_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jonah prayed unto Jehovah his God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> out of the fish's belly; <a id="c2_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and he said: I cried by reason of my distress unto Jehovah, and he answered me; Out of the belly of Sheol cried I: thou heardest my voice. <a id="c2_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> For thou didst cast me into the depth, into the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me: All thy breakers and thy billows are gone over me. <a id="c2_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes, Yet will I look again toward thy holy temple. <a id="c2_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> The waters encompassed me, to the soul: The deep was round about me, The weeds were wrapped about my head. <a id="c2_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The bars of the earth closed upon me for ever: But thou hast brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a>  <a id="c2_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; And my prayer came in unto thee, Into thy holy temple. <a id="c2_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. <a id="c2_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c2_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Jehovah commanded the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.</p>
