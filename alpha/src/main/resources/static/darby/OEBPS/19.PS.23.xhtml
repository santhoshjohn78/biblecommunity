<h2>Psalms 23</h2>

<p><a id="c23_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Jehovah is my shepherd; I shall not want. <a id="c23_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside still waters. <a id="c23_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. <a id="c23_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. <a id="c23_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup runneth over. <a id="c23_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Surely, goodness and loving-kindness shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of Jehovah for the length of the days.</p>
