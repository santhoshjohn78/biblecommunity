<h2>1 Samuel 20</h2>

<p><a id="c20_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And David fled from Naioth by Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity, and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeks my life? <a id="c20_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he said to him, God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, and not apprise me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so. <a id="c20_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And David swore again and again, and said, Thy father certainly knows that I have found favour in thy sight: and he has thought, Jonathan shall not know this, lest he be grieved; but truly as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death. <a id="c20_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Jonathan said to David, What thy soul may say, I will even do it for thee. <a id="c20_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening. <a id="c20_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> If thy father should actually miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city; for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family. <a id="c20_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> If he say thus, It is well, --thy servant shall have peace; but if he be very wroth, be sure that evil is determined by him. <a id="c20_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Deal kindly then with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee; but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?</p>

<p><a id="c20_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee; for, if I knew with certainty that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, would I not tell it thee? <a id="c20_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly? <a id="c20_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Jonathan said to David, Come and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field. <a id="c20_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Jonathan said to David, Jehovah, God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of Israel, when I sound my father about this time to-morrow, or the next day, and behold, there be good toward David, and I then send not to thee, and apprise thee of it, <a id="c20_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Jehovah do so and much more to Jonathan. Should it please my father to do thee evil, then I will apprise thee of it, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace; and Jehovah be with thee, as he has been with my father. <a id="c20_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of Jehovah, that I die not, <a id="c20_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> but thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever, no, not when Jehovah cuts off the enemies of David, every one from the face of the earth. <a id="c20_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let Jehovah even require it at the hand of David's enemies! <a id="c20_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Jonathan caused David to swear again, by the love he had for him, for he loved him as he loved his own soul. <a id="c20_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Jonathan said to him, To-morrow is the new moon; and thou wilt be missed, for thy seat will be empty; <a id="c20_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> but on the third day thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself on the day of the business, and abide by the stone Ezel. <a id="c20_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot at a mark. <a id="c20_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And behold, I will send the lad, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I expressly say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come, for there is peace for thee, and it is nothing; as Jehovah liveth. <a id="c20_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> But if I say thus to the youth: Behold, the arrows are beyond thee, --go thy way; for Jehovah sends thee away. <a id="c20_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And as to the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between me and thee for ever.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And David hid himself in the field; and it was the new moon, and the king sat at table to eat. <a id="c20_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And the king sat on his seat, as at other times, on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty. <a id="c20_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And Saul said nothing that day; for he thought, Something has befallen him, that he is not clean: surely he is not clean. <a id="c20_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And it came to pass the next day after the new moon, the second day of the month, as David's place was empty, that Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has not the son of Jesse come to table, neither yesterday nor to-day? <a id="c20_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem, <a id="c20_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> and said, Let me go, I pray thee; for we have a family sacrifice in the city; and my brother himself has commanded me to be there; and now, if I have found favour in thy sight, let me go away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. He has therefore not come to the king's table. <a id="c20_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> And Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame and to the shame of thy mother's nakedness? <a id="c20_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. And now send and fetch him to me, for he must die. <a id="c20_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why should he be put to death? what has he done? <a id="c20_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Then Saul cast the spear at him to smite him; and Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to put David to death. <a id="c20_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no meat the second day of the new moon; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</p>

<p><a id="c20_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And it came to pass in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field, to the place agreed on with David, and a little lad with him. <a id="c20_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And he said to his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. The lad ran, and he shot the arrow beyond him. <a id="c20_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> And when the lad came to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad and said, Is not the arrow away beyond thee? <a id="c20_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not! And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. <a id="c20_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> And the lad knew nothing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter. <a id="c20_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city. <a id="c20_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> The lad went, and David arose from the side of the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times; and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded. <a id="c20_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have both of us sworn in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever! And he arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.</p>
