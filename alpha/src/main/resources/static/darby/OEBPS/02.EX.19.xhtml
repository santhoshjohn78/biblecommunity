<h2>Exodus 19</h2>

<p><a id="c19_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> In the third month after the departure of the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai: <a id="c19_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> they departed from Rephidim, and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped in the wilderness; and Israel encamped there before the mountain. <a id="c19_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Moses went up to God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> and Jehovah called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: <a id="c19_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Ye have seen what I have done to the Egyptians, and how I have borne you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. <a id="c19_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And now, if ye will hearken to my voice indeed and keep my covenant, then shall ye be my own possession out of all the peoples--for all the earth is mine-- <a id="c19_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak to the children of Israel. <a id="c19_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Moses came and called the elders of the people, and laid before the mall these words which Jehovah had commanded him. <a id="c19_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah has spoken will we do! And Moses brought the words of the people back to Jehovah.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Jehovah said to Moses, Lo, I will come to thee in the cloud's thick darkness, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee also for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to Jehovah. <a id="c19_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to the people, and hallow them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their clothes; <a id="c19_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and let them be ready for the third day; for on the third day Jehovah will come down before the eyes of all the people on mount Sinai. <a id="c19_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And set bounds round about the people, saying, Take heed to yourselves, not to go up unto the mountain nor touch the border of it: whatever toucheth the mountain shall certainly be put to death: <a id="c19_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> not a hand shall touch it, but it shall certainly be stoned, or shot through; whether it be a beast or a man, it shall not live. When the long drawn note of the trumpet soundeth, they shall come up to the mountain. <a id="c19_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And Moses came down from the mountain to the people, and hallowed the people; and they washed their clothes. <a id="c19_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day; do not come near your wives.</p>

<p><a id="c19_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings and a heavy cloud on the mountain, and the sound of the trumpet exceeding loud; and the whole people that was in the camp trembled. <a id="c19_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> and they stood at the foot of the mountain. <a id="c19_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the whole of mount Sinai smoked, because Jehovah descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended as the smoke of a furnace; and the whole mountain shook greatly. <a id="c19_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And the sound of the trumpet increased and became exceeding loud; Moses spoke, and God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> answered him by a voice. <a id="c19_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Jehovah came down on mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain; and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. <a id="c19_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And Jehovah said to Moses, Go down, testify to the people that they break not through to Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish. <a id="c19_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And the priests also, who come near to Jehovah, shall hallow themselves, lest Jehovah break forth on them. <a id="c19_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Moses said to Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai; for thou hast testified to us, saying, Set bounds about the mountain, and hallow it. <a id="c19_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Jehovah said to him, Go, descend, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee; but the priests and the people shall not break through to go up to Jehovah, lest he break forth on them. <a id="c19_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> So Moses went down to the people, and told them.</p>
