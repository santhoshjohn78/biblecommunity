<h2>1 Chronicles 18</h2>

<p><a id="c18_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines. <a id="c18_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And he smote the Moabites; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts. <a id="c18_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah, at Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates. <a id="c18_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots. <a id="c18_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, and David smote of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men. <a id="c18_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And Jehovah preserved David whithersoever he went. <a id="c18_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. <a id="c18_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much brass, of which Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</p>

<p><a id="c18_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And Tou king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the forces of Hadarezer king of Zobah; <a id="c18_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> and he sent Hadoram his son to king David to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him; for Hadarezer was continually at war with Tou; he sent also all manner of vessels of gold and silver and bronze. <a id="c18_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Them also king David dedicated to Jehovah, with the silver and the gold that he had brought from all the nations: from the Edomites, and from the Moabites, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from the Amalekites. <a id="c18_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And Abishai the son of Zeruiah smote of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand. <a id="c18_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And he put garrisons in Edom; and all they of Edom became servants to David. And Jehovah preserved David whithersoever he went. <a id="c18_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice to all his people. <a id="c18_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was chronicler; <a id="c18_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; <a id="c18_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were the first at the king's hand.</p>
