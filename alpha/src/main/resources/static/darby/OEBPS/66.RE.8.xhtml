<h2>Revelation 8</h2>

<p><a id="c8_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And when it opened the seventh seal, there was silence in the heaven about half an hour. <a id="c8_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. <a id="c8_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, that he might give efficacy to the prayers of all saints at the golden altar which was before the throne. <a id="c8_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints, out of the hand of the angel before God. <a id="c8_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the angel took the censer, and filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast it on the earth: and there were voices, and thunders and lightnings, and an earthquake. <a id="c8_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves that they might sound with their trumpets.</p>

<p><a id="c8_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the first sounded his trumpet: and there was hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth; and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. <a id="c8_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the second angel sounded his trumpet: and as a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea, and the third part of the sea became blood; <a id="c8_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea which had life died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed. <a id="c8_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the third angel sounded his trumpet: and there fell out of the heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters. <a id="c8_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many of the men died of the waters because they were made bitter. <a id="c8_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And the fourth angel sounded his trumpet: and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so that the third part of them should be darkened, and that the day should not appear for the third part of it, and the night the same. <a id="c8_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to them that dwell upon the earth, for the remaining voices of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound.</p>
