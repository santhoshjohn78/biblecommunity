<h2>Ecclesiastes 7</h2>

<p><a id="c7_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> A good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of one's birth. <a id="c7_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: in that that is the end of all men, and the living taketh it to heart. <a id="c7_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Vexation is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. <a id="c7_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools in the house of mirth. <a id="c7_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise, than to hear the song of fools. <a id="c7_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad, and a gift destroyeth the heart. <a id="c7_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Better is the end of a thing than its beginning; better is a patient spirit than a proud spirit. <a id="c7_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Be not hasty in thy spirit to be vexed; for vexation resteth in the bosom of fools. <a id="c7_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Say not, How is it that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, and profitable to them that see the sun. <a id="c7_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> For wisdom is a defence as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom maketh them that possess it to live. <a id="c7_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> Consider the work of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> for who can make straight what he hath made crooked? <a id="c7_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> In the day of prosperity enjoy good, and in the day of adversity consider: God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> hath also set the one beside the other, to the end that man should find out nothing of what shall be after him. <a id="c7_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> All this have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a righteous man that perisheth by his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his days by his wickedness. <a id="c7_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? <a id="c7_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? <a id="c7_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> cometh forth from them all. <a id="c7_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men that are in a city. <a id="c7_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not. <a id="c7_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Also give not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee. <a id="c7_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> For also thine own heart knoweth that oftentimes thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</p>

<p><a id="c7_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> All this have I tried by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me. <a id="c7_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> Whatever hath been, is far off, and exceeding deep: who will find it out? <a id="c7_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> I turned, I and my heart, to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom and reason, and to know wickedness to be folly, and foolishness to be madness; <a id="c7_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> and I found more bitter than death the woman whose heart is nets and snares, and whose hands are bands: whoso pleaseth God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be caught by her. <a id="c7_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> See this which I have found, saith the Preacher, searching one by one to find out the reason; <a id="c7_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> which my soul yet seeketh, and I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found, but a woman among all those have I not found. <a id="c7_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Only see this which I have found: that God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> made man upright, but they have sought out many devices.</p>
