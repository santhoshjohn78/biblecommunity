<h2>Genesis 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Abram was ninety-nine years old, when Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty Â·God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> walk before my face, and be perfect. <a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And I will set my covenant between me and thee, and will very greatly multiply thee. <a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Abram fell on his face; and God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> talked with him, saying,</p>

<p><a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> It is I: behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of a multitude of nations. <a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And thy name shall no more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of a multitude of nations have I made thee. <a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> to thee, and to thy seed after thee. <a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And I give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojourning, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be a God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a> to them. <a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> said to Abraham, And as for thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou and thy seed after thee in their generations. <a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> This is my covenant which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee--that every male among you be circumcised. <a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and that shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you. <a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And at eight days old shall every male in your generations be circumcised among you--he who is born in the house, and he who is bought with money, any stranger who is not of thy seed. <a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He who is born in thy house, and he who is bought with thy money, must be circumcised; and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. <a id="c17_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the uncircumcised male who hath not been circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his peoples: he hath broken my covenant.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> said to Abraham, As to Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. <a id="c17_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And I will bless her, and I will give thee a son also of her; and I will bless her, and she shall become nations: kings of peoples shall be of her. <a id="c17_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear? <a id="c17_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And Abraham said to God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> Oh that Ishmael might live before thee! <a id="c17_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote8">*</a> said, Sarah thy wife shall indeed bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac; and I will establish my covenant with him, for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him. <a id="c17_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And for Ishmael I have heard thee: behold, I will bless him, and will make him fruitful, and will very greatly multiply him; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. <a id="c17_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this appointed time in the next year. <a id="c17_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And he left off talking with him; and God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote9">*</a> went up from Abraham.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money--every male among the people of Abraham's house--and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on that same day, as God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote10">*</a> had said to him. <a id="c17_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. <a id="c17_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. <a id="c17_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son; <a id="c17_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> and all the men of his house, born in his house, or bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.</p>
