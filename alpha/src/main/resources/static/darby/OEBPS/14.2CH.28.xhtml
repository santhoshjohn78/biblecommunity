<h2>2 Chronicles 28</h2>

<p><a id="c28_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not what was right in the sight of Jehovah, like David his father, <a id="c28_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> but walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and even made molten images for the Baals; <a id="c28_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> and he burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burned his sons in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from before the children of Israel. <a id="c28_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. <a id="c28_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Therefore Jehovah his God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> gave him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of their fathers. <a id="c28_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah the second to the king. <a id="c28_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took away also much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. <a id="c28_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he gave them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reaches up to heaven. <a id="c28_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And now ye think to subjugate the children of Judah and Jerusalem as your bondmen and bondwomen. Are there not with you, even with you, trespasses against Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote4">*</a>  <a id="c28_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And now hear me, and send back the captives again, whom ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you. <a id="c28_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Hezekiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war, <a id="c28_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> and said to them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither; because, for our guilt before Jehovah, ye think to increase our sins and our trespasses: for our trespass is great, and fierce wrath is upon Israel. <a id="c28_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Then the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation. <a id="c28_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And the men that have been expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them on asses, and brought them to Jericho the city of palm-trees, to their brethren. And they returned to Samaria.</p>

<p><a id="c28_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him. <a id="c28_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And again the Edomites came and smote Judah, and carried away captives. <a id="c28_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the Philistines invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the south of Judah, and took Beth-shemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Socho and its dependent villages, and Timnah and its dependent villages, and Guimzo and its dependent villages; and they dwelt there. <a id="c28_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> For Jehovah humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had made Judah lawless, and transgressed much against Jehovah. <a id="c28_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Tilgath-Pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and troubled him, and did not support him. <a id="c28_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> For Ahaz stripped the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king and of the princes, and gave to the king of Assyria; but he was of no help to him. <a id="c28_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And in the time of his trouble he transgressed yet more against Jehovah, this king Ahaz. <a id="c28_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which had smitten him; and he said, Since the gods of the kings of Syria help them, I will sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel. <a id="c28_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And Ahaz gathered the vessels of the house of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote5">*</a> and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote6">*</a> and closed the doors of the house of Jehovah, and he made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem. <a id="c28_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah the God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote7">*</a> of his fathers. <a id="c28_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. <a id="c28_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem; but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
