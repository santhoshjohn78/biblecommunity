<h2>Job 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Zophar the Naamathite answered and said, <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man of much talk be justified? <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Should thy fictions make men hold their peace? and shouldest thou mock, and no one make thee ashamed? <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> But oh that +God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> would speak, and open his lips against thee; <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, how that they are the double of what is realised; and know that +God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> passeth by much of thine iniquity!</p>

<p><a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> Canst thou by searching find out +God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection? <a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> It is as the heights of heaven; what wilt thou do? deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know? <a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. <a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> If he pass by, and shut up, and call to judgment, who can hinder him? <a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> For he knoweth vain men, and seeth wickedness when man doth not consider it; <a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> Yet a senseless man will make bold, though man be born like the foal of a wild ass.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> If thou prepare thy heart and stretch out thy hands toward him, <a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> If thou put far away the iniquity which is in thy hand, and let not wrong dwell in thy tents; <a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot, and thou shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear: <a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> For thou shalt forget misery; as waters that are passed away shalt thou remember it; <a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And life shall arise brighter than noonday; though thou be enshrouded in darkness, thou shalt be as the morning, <a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And thou shalt have confidence, because there shall be hope; and having searched about thee, thou shalt take rest in safety. <a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Yea, thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; and many shall seek thy favour. <a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and all refuge shall vanish from them, and their hope shall be the breathing out of life.</p>
