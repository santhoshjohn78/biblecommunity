<h2>Joshua 17</h2>

<p><a id="c17_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And the lot came to the tribe of Manasseh (for he was the firstborn of Joseph), to Machir, the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, for he was a man of war, and he had Gilead and Bashan. <a id="c17_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> There was also a portion for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these are the children of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, the males, according to their families. <a id="c17_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. <a id="c17_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. And he gave them according to the commandment of Jehovah an inheritance among the brethren of their father. <a id="c17_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which are beyond the Jordan. <a id="c17_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons; and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And the territory of Manasseh was from Asher to Micmethath, which is before Shechem, and the border went on the right hand toward the inhabitants of En-Tappuah. <a id="c17_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Manasseh had the land of Tappuah; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim. <a id="c17_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And the border descended to the torrent Kanah, south of the torrent. These cities were Ephraim's among the cities of Manasseh. And the territory of Manasseh was on the north side of the torrent, and ended at the sea. <a id="c17_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea was his border. And they touched upon Asher on the north, and upon Issachar on the east. <a id="c17_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher, Beth-shean and its dependent villages, and Ibleam and its dependent villages, and the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent villages, and the inhabitants of En-Dor and its dependent villages, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its dependent villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its dependent villages, the three hilly regions. <a id="c17_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> But the children of Manasseh could not dispossess the inhabitants of those cities; and the Canaanites would dwell in that land. <a id="c17_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And it came to pass when the children of Israel were become strong, that they made the Canaanites tributary; but they did not utterly dispossess them.</p>

<p><a id="c17_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me as inheritance one lot and one portion, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as Jehovah has blessed me hitherto? <a id="c17_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And Joshua said unto them, If thou art a great people, then get thee up to the wood, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee. <a id="c17_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the children of Joseph said, The hill-country will not be enough for us; and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, those that are of Beth-shean and its dependent villages, and those that are in the valley of Jizreel. <a id="c17_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only, <a id="c17_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> but the hill-country shall be thine, as it is a wood, thou shalt cut it down, and its outgoings shall be thine; for thou shalt dispossess the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots; for they are powerful.</p>
