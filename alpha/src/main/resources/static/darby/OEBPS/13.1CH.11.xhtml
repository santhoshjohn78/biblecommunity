<h2>1 Chronicles 11</h2>

<p><a id="c11_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And all Israel assembled themselves to David to Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. <a id="c11_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Even aforetime, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel; and Jehovah thy God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over my people Israel. <a id="c11_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah; and they anointed David king over Israel according to the word of Jehovah through Samuel. <a id="c11_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land. <a id="c11_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come in hither. But David took the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David. <a id="c11_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And David said, Whoever smites the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief. <a id="c11_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David. <a id="c11_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And he built the city round about, even from the Millo round about; and Joab renewed the rest of the city. <a id="c11_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And David became continually greater; and Jehovah of hosts was with him.</p>

<p><a id="c11_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who shewed themselves valiant with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. <a id="c11_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of Hachmoni, the chief of the captains; he brandished his spear against three hundred, slain by him at one time. <a id="c11_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And after him, Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite; he was one of the three mighty men. <a id="c11_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> He was with David at Pas-dammim, where the Philistines were gathered together to battle; and there was there a plot of ground full of barley; and the people had fled from before the Philistines. <a id="c11_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And they stood in the midst of the plot and delivered it, and smote the Philistines; and Jehovah wrought a great deliverance. <a id="c11_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock to David, to the cave of Adullam, when the army of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim. <a id="c11_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And David was then in the stronghold; and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem. <a id="c11_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate! <a id="c11_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; David however would not drink of it, but poured it out to Jehovah. <a id="c11_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And he said, My God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> forbid it me, that I should do this thing! should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives? for at the risk of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men. <a id="c11_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was the chief of three; and he brandished his spear against three hundred and slew them; and he had a name among the three. <a id="c11_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> Of the three he was more honourable than the two, and he was their captain; but he did not attain to the first three. <a id="c11_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, great in exploits, of Kabzeel: he it was that smote two lions of Moab; and he went down and smote a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day. <a id="c11_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> He also smote the Egyptian, a man of stature, five cubits high: and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. <a id="c11_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he had a name among the three mighty men. <a id="c11_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> Behold, he was honoured above the thirty, but he did not attain to the first three. And David set him in his council. <a id="c11_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And the valiant men of the forces were: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, <a id="c11_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, <a id="c11_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, <a id="c11_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> Sibbechai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, <a id="c11_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, <a id="c11_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, <a id="c11_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, <a id="c11_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, <a id="c11_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> Bene-Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite, <a id="c11_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, <a id="c11_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, <a id="c11_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, <a id="c11_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, <a id="c11_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armour-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, <a id="c11_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, <a id="c11_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, <a id="c11_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him; <a id="c11_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, <a id="c11_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> Uzzia the Ashtarothite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite, <a id="c11_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite, <a id="c11_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> Eliel of Mahavim, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Jithmah the Moabite, <a id="c11_v47"></a><span class="vn">47</span> Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.</p>
