<h2>Revelation 21</h2>

<p><a id="c21_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea exists no more. <a id="c21_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <a id="c21_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And I heard a loud voice out of the heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, their God. <a id="c21_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall not exist any more, nor grief, nor cry, nor distress shall exist any more, for the former things have passed away. <a id="c21_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And he that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he says to me, Write, for these words are true and faithful. <a id="c21_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And he said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that thirsts of the fountain of the water of life freely. <a id="c21_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> He that overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son. <a id="c21_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> But to the fearful and unbelieving, and sinners, and those who make themselves abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.</p>

<p><a id="c21_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And there came one of the seven angels which had had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke with me, saying, Come here, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. <a id="c21_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And he carried me away in the Spirit, and set me on a great and high mountain, and shewed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, <a id="c21_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> having the glory of God. Her shining was like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone; <a id="c21_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are those of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. <a id="c21_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> On the east three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. <a id="c21_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. <a id="c21_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And he that spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure, that he might measure the city, and its gates, and its wall. <a id="c21_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And the city lies four-square, and its length is as much as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed--twelve thousand stadia: the length and the breadth and height of it are equal. <a id="c21_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, a man's measure, that is, the angel's. <a id="c21_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And the building of its wall was jasper; and the city pure gold, like pure glass: <a id="c21_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation, jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; <a id="c21_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. <a id="c21_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And the twelve gates, twelve pearls; each one of the gates, respectively, was of one pearl; and the street of the city pure gold, as transparent glass. <a id="c21_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> And I saw no temple in it; for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb. <a id="c21_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon, that they should shine for it; for the glory of God has enlightened it, and the lamp thereof is the Lamb. <a id="c21_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> And the nations shall walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory to it. <a id="c21_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And its gates shall not be shut at all by day, for night shall not be there. <a id="c21_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations to it. <a id="c21_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And nothing common, nor that maketh an abomination and a lie, shall at all enter into it; but those only who are written in the book of life of the Lamb.</p>
