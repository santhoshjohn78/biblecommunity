<h2>2 Corinthians 12</h2>

<p><a id="c12_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> Well, it is not of profit to me to boast, for I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. <a id="c12_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows;) such a one caught up to the third heaven. <a id="c12_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And I know such a man, (whether in the body or out of the body I know not, God knows;) <a id="c12_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter. <a id="c12_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> Of such a one I will boast, but of myself I will not boast, unless in my weaknesses. <a id="c12_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> For if I shall desire to boast, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth; but I forbear, lest any one should think as to me above what he sees me to be, or whatever he may hear of me. <a id="c12_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And that I might not be exalted by the exceeding greatness of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn for the flesh, a messenger of Satan that he might buffet me, that I might not be exalted. <a id="c12_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> For this I thrice besought the Lord that it might depart from me. <a id="c12_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And he said to me, My grace suffices thee; for my power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me. <a id="c12_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, in straits, for Christ: for when I am weak, then I am powerful.</p>

<p><a id="c12_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> I have become a fool; ye have compelled me; for I ought to have been commended by you; for I have been nothing behind those who were in surpassing degree apostles, if also I am nothing. <a id="c12_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> The signs indeed of the apostle were wrought among you in all endurance, signs, and wonders, and works of power. <a id="c12_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> For in what is it that ye have been inferior to the other assemblies, unless that I myself have not been in laziness a charge upon you? Forgive me this injury. <a id="c12_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be in laziness a charge; for I do not seek yours, but you; for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. <a id="c12_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> Now I shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls, if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved. <a id="c12_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> But be it so. I did not burden you, but being crafty I took you by guile. <a id="c12_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> Did I make gain of you by any of those whom I have sent to you? <a id="c12_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> I begged Titus, and sent the brother with him: did Titus at all make gain of you? have we not walked in the same spirit? have we not in the same steps? <a id="c12_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> Ye have long been supposing that we excuse ourselves to you: we speak before God in Christ; and all things, beloved, for your building up. <a id="c12_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> For I fear lest perhaps coming I find you not such as I wish, and that I be found by you such as ye do not wish: lest there might be strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, evil speakings, whisperings, puffings up, disturbances; <a id="c12_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> lest my God should humble me as to you when I come again, and that I shall grieve over many of those who have sinned before, and have not repented as to the uncleanness and fornication and licentiousness which they have practised.</p>
