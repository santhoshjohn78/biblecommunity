<h2>Leviticus 24</h2>

<p><a id="c24_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, <a id="c24_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> Command the children of Israel that they bring unto thee pure beaten olive oil for the light, to light the lamp continually. <a id="c24_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Outside the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron dress it from evening to morning before Jehovah continually: it is an everlasting statute throughout your generations. <a id="c24_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> Upon the pure candlestick shall he arrange the lamps before Jehovah continually. <a id="c24_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And thou shalt take fine wheaten flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof; each cake shall be of two tenths. <a id="c24_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And thou shalt set them in two rows, six in a row, upon the pure table before Jehovah. <a id="c24_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row; and it shall be a bread of remembrance, an offering by fire to Jehovah. <a id="c24_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Every sabbath day he shall arrange it before Jehovah continually, on the part of the children of Israel: it is an everlasting covenant. <a id="c24_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy unto him of Jehovah's offerings by fire: it is an everlasting statute.</p>

<p><a id="c24_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And the son of an Israelitish woman--but withal the son of an Egyptian, --went out among the children of Israel; and this son of the Israelitess and a man of Israel strove together in the camp; <a id="c24_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. And his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. <a id="c24_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And they confined him, that they might decide at the mouth of Jehovah. <a id="c24_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, <a id="c24_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> Lead the reviler outside the camp; and all that heard him shall lay their hands upon his head, and the whole assembly shall stone him. <a id="c24_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Every one when he revileth his God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> shall bear his sin. <a id="c24_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> And he that blasphemeth the name of Jehovah shall certainly be put to death; all the assembly shall certainly stone him; as well the stranger as he that is home-born, when he blasphemeth the Name, shall be put to death. <a id="c24_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And if any one smiteth any man mortally, he shall certainly be put to death. <a id="c24_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life. <a id="c24_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour, as he hath done, so shall it be done to him; <a id="c24_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him. <a id="c24_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> He that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good; and he that smiteth a man mortally shall be put to death. <a id="c24_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Ye shall have one law: as the stranger, so the home-born; for I am Jehovah your God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a>  <a id="c24_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> And Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they led the reviler outside the camp and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</p>
