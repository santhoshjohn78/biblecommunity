<h2>Exodus 29</h2>

<p><a id="c29_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> And this is the thing which thou shalt do to them to hallow them, that they may serve me as priests: take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish, <a id="c29_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> and unleavened bread, and unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil--of wheaten flour shalt thou make them. <a id="c29_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> And thou shalt put them into one basket, and present them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams. <a id="c29_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring near the entrance of the tent of meeting, and shalt bathe them with water. <a id="c29_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> And thou shalt take the garments, and clothe Aaron with the vest, and the cloak of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and shalt gird him with the girdle of the ephod. <a id="c29_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> And thou shalt put the turban upon his head, and fasten the holy diadem to the turban, <a id="c29_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> and shalt take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head, and anoint him. <a id="c29_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> And thou shalt bring his sons near, and clothe them with the vests. <a id="c29_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> And thou shalt gird them with the girdle--Aaron and his sons, and bind the high caps on them; and the priesthood shall be theirs for an everlasting statute; and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons. <a id="c29_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> And thou shalt present the bullock before the tent of meeting; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock; <a id="c29_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> and thou shalt slaughter the bullock before Jehovah, at the entrance of the tent of meeting; <a id="c29_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> and thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it on the horns of the altar with thy finger, and shalt pour all the blood at the bottom of the altar. <a id="c29_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the net of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar. <a id="c29_v14"></a><span class="vn">14</span> And the flesh of the bullock, and its skin, and its dung, shalt thou burn with fire outside the camp: it is a sin-offering. <a id="c29_v15"></a><span class="vn">15</span> And thou shalt take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram; <a id="c29_v16"></a><span class="vn">16</span> and thou shalt slaughter the ram, and shalt take its blood, and sprinkle it on the altar round about. <a id="c29_v17"></a><span class="vn">17</span> And thou shalt cut up the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards, and its legs, and put them upon its pieces, and upon its head; <a id="c29_v18"></a><span class="vn">18</span> and thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering to Jehovah--a sweet odour; it is an offering by fire to Jehovah. <a id="c29_v19"></a><span class="vn">19</span> And thou shalt take the second ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram; <a id="c29_v20"></a><span class="vn">20</span> and thou shalt slaughter the ram, and take of its blood, and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot; and thou shalt sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. <a id="c29_v21"></a><span class="vn">21</span> And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him. <a id="c29_v22"></a><span class="vn">22</span> Also of the ram shalt thou take the fat, and the fat-tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the net of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder--for it is a ram of consecration-- <a id="c29_v23"></a><span class="vn">23</span> and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before Jehovah; <a id="c29_v24"></a><span class="vn">24</span> and thou shalt put all this in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons, and shalt wave them as a wave-offering before Jehovah. <a id="c29_v25"></a><span class="vn">25</span> And thou shalt receive them of their hand and burn them upon the altar over the burnt-offering, for a sweet odour before Jehovah: it is an offering by fire to Jehovah. <a id="c29_v26"></a><span class="vn">26</span> And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of consecration which is for Aaron, and wave it as a wave-offering before Jehovah; and it shall be thy part. <a id="c29_v27"></a><span class="vn">27</span> And thou shalt hallow the breast of the wave-offering, and the shoulder of the heave-offering, that hath been waved and heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons. <a id="c29_v28"></a><span class="vn">28</span> And they shall be for Aaron and his sons, as an everlasting statute, on the part of the children of Israel; for it is a heave-offering; and it shall be a heave-offering on the part of the children of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, as their heave-offering to Jehovah. <a id="c29_v29"></a><span class="vn">29</span> And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them. <a id="c29_v30"></a><span class="vn">30</span> The son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tent of meeting to serve in the sanctuary. <a id="c29_v31"></a><span class="vn">31</span> And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and boil its flesh in a holy place. <a id="c29_v32"></a><span class="vn">32</span> And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. <a id="c29_v33"></a><span class="vn">33</span> They shall eat the things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate and to hallow them; but a stranger shall not eat of them, for they are holy. <a id="c29_v34"></a><span class="vn">34</span> And if any of the flesh of the consecration, and of the bread, remain until the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, for it is holy. <a id="c29_v35"></a><span class="vn">35</span> And thus shalt thou do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them. <a id="c29_v36"></a><span class="vn">36</span> And thou shalt offer every day a bullock as a sin-offering for atonement; and the altar shalt thou cleanse from sin, by making atonement for it, and shalt anoint it, to hallow it. <a id="c29_v37"></a><span class="vn">37</span> Seven days shalt thou make atonement for the altar and hallow it; and the altar shall be most holy: whatever toucheth the altar shall be holy.</p>

<p><a id="c29_v38"></a><span class="vn">38</span> And this is what thou shalt offer upon the altar--two lambs of the first year, day by day continually. <a id="c29_v39"></a><span class="vn">39</span> The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer between the two evenings. <a id="c29_v40"></a><span class="vn">40</span> And with the one lamb a tenth part of wheaten flour mingled with beaten oil, a fourth part of a hin; and a drink-offering, a fourth part of a hin of wine. <a id="c29_v41"></a><span class="vn">41</span> And the second lamb shalt thou offer between the two evenings; as the oblation in the morning, and as its drink-offering shalt thou offer with this, for a sweet odour, an offering by fire to Jehovah. <a id="c29_v42"></a><span class="vn">42</span> It shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, where I will meet with you, to speak there with thee. <a id="c29_v43"></a><span class="vn">43</span> And there will I meet with the children of Israel; and it shall be hallowed by my glory. <a id="c29_v44"></a><span class="vn">44</span> And I will hallow the tent of meeting, and the altar; and I will hallow Aaron and his sons, that they may serve me as priests. <a id="c29_v45"></a><span class="vn">45</span> And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and will be their God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a>  <a id="c29_v46"></a><span class="vn">46</span> And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> who have brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, to dwell in their midst: I am Jehovah their God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> .</p>
