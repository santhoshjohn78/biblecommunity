<h2>Psalms 79</h2>

<p><a id="c79_v1"></a><span class="vn">1</span> O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote1">*</a> the nations are come into thine inheritance: thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem in heaps. <a id="c79_v2"></a><span class="vn">2</span> The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowl of the heavens, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth: <a id="c79_v3"></a><span class="vn">3</span> Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them. <a id="c79_v4"></a><span class="vn">4</span> We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a mockery and a derision to them that are round about us. <a id="c79_v5"></a><span class="vn">5</span> How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry for ever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?</p>

<p><a id="c79_v6"></a><span class="vn">6</span> Pour out thy fury upon the nations that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name: <a id="c79_v7"></a><span class="vn">7</span> For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation. <a id="c79_v8"></a><span class="vn">8</span> Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers; let thy tender mercies speedily come to meet us: for we are brought very low. <a id="c79_v9"></a><span class="vn">9</span> Help us, O God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote2">*</a> of our salvation, because of the glory of thy name; and deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name's sake. <a id="c79_v10"></a><span class="vn">10</span> Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote3">*</a> Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants that is shed be known among the nations in our sight. <a id="c79_v11"></a><span class="vn">11</span> Let the groaning of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thine arm, preserve those that are appointed to die; <a id="c79_v12"></a><span class="vn">12</span> And render unto our neighbours, sevenfold into their bosom, their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. <a id="c79_v13"></a><span class="vn">13</span> And we, thy people and the sheep of thy pasture, will give thanks unto thee for ever; we will shew forth thy praise from generation to generation.</p>
